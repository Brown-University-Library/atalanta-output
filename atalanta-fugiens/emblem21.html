                        That there are some <span class="choice"><span class="orig">certaine </span><span class="reg">certain</span></span> sparks of knowledge naturally radicated in

If Geometry be <span class="choice"><span class="orig">soe </span><span class="reg">so</span></span> <span class="choice"><span class="orig">naturall </span><span class="reg">natural</span></span> and easy to children, how comes it to <span class="choice"><span class="orig">passe </span><span class="reg">pass</span></span>
                        that the Square of a circle was not <span class="choice"><span class="orig">knowne </span><span class="reg">known</span></span> to Plato <span class="choice"><span class="orig">himselfe </span><span class="reg">himself</span></span>, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Soe </span><span class="reg">So</span></span> that Aristotle the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Schollar </span><span class="reg">Scholar</span></span> of Plato affirmed it possible to be <span class="choice"><span class="orig">knowne </span><span class="reg">known</span></span>, but not as yet 
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">knowne </span><span class="reg">known</span></span>; but it is evident that it was not <span class="choice"><span class="orig">unknowne </span><span class="reg">unknown</span></span> to the <span class="choice"><span class="orig">naturall </span><span class="reg">natural</span></span> Philosophers, because they <span class="choice"><span class="orig">coá¸¿and </span><span class="reg">command</span></span> a circle to be converted into a quadrangle, and
                        this, by a triangle, <span class="choice"><span class="orig">againe </span><span class="reg">again</span></span> into a circle: by which they <span class="choice"><span class="orig">meane </span><span class="reg">mean</span></span> a most simple

                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Ã¦quilaterall </span><span class="reg">equilateral</span></span>. Now that this quadration is <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Physicall </span><span class="reg">Physical</span></span> and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">agreable </span><span class="reg">agreeable</span></span> to nature,

                        Solid figures, for example, of Sphere and Cube can be <span class="choice"><span class="orig">knowne </span><span class="reg">known</span></span>, and <span class="choice"><span class="orig">transferrd </span><span class="reg">transferred</span></span>
                        to <span class="choice"><span class="orig">manuall </span><span class="reg">manual</span></span> use or practice: If the capacity or circumference of a Sphere be

                        Philosophers would have the quadrangle reduced into a triangle, that is, into
