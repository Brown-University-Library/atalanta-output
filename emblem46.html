                        declared; but these things being divulged in the writings of the most

                        ignorant occasion to ascribe religion and veneration to Apollo: Hereupon Apollo is in many places of Europe and Asia worshipped, 
                        and innumerable temples erected to him; And especially at Delphos
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hee </span><span class="reg">he</span></span> had a temple to be worshipped by ancient religion, wherein a great
                        number of statues made of solid gold and silver or great weight 
                        and artifice was reposited by Kings and Princes, with other most
                        <span class="choice"><span class="orig">pretious </span><span class="reg">precious</span></span> gifts, which were hidden in sacred places for religion sake
                        by men of all degrees. Pausanias reports that a brazen Skeleton of
                        admirable artifice was hung at the top of the temple by Hippocrates.
                        That famous Tripos was <span class="choice"><span class="orig">allso </span><span class="reg">also</span></span> consecrated to Apollo by Pelops, at the

                        to come: Delphos was indeed in <span class="choice"><span class="orig">BÅ“otica </span><span class="reg">Boeotica</span></span> seated about the foot of Parnassus. 
                        Near to the temple was the divining <span class="choice"><span class="orig">fountaine </span><span class="reg">fountain</span></span>, named Cassiotis, which, if burning torches was brought to it did extinguish them: if they were removed

                        that <span class="choice"><span class="orig">fountaine </span><span class="reg">fountain</span></span> being <span class="choice"><span class="orig">dranke </span><span class="reg">drank</span></span> <span class="choice"><span class="orig">yeilded </span><span class="reg">yielded</span></span> the virtue of divining, but notwithstanding the drinkers of that water were made of shorter life.

                        not being supported by the reputation of history, it is not derogatory from the
                        truth, to ascribe it to <span class="choice"><span class="orig">Chymicall </span><span class="reg">Chymical</span></span> matters, especially Apollo being, as <span class="choice"><span class="orig">hath </span><span class="reg">has</span></span> been

                        The two Eagles are two stones, whereof one comes from the East, the 
                        other from the West, which the Philosophers have many <span class="choice"><span class="orig">wayes </span><span class="reg">ways</span></span> demonstrated.
