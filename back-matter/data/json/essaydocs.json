His life was dedicated to an ill-fated quest for the Philosophers’ Stone, a quintessential extract of gold thought to possess divine healing powers mediated by the sun. In both his printed works and his practice as a physician, Maier charted an uneasy course between the traditional Galenic “book learning” of his schooling and the empirical chemical medicine pioneered by Paracelsus. As Paracelsian practice involved recourse to supernatural forces, Maier was also obliged to negotiate theological tensions between the Lutheran faith of his upbringing and the inspirationist pursuit of divine revelation unmediated by the ecclesiastical hierarchies. The Paracelsian inspirationism of Maier’s time was epitomised by the Rosicrucian manifestos, and anyone publically defending their programme — as Maier did in his Silentium post clamores (1617) and Themis aurea (1618) — ran substantial risk of persecution amid the rising sectarian hostilities of the Counter-Reformation. Yet esoteric knowledge transmitted in manuscript and oral form possessed significant currency among certain sections of the nobility, and as Europe descended into economic collapse and the devastation of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), Maier’s resort to this “economy of secrets” became increasingly desperate.A map of Maier’s peregrinations graphically depicts an early modern alchemist’s quest for medicines, for the knowledge and raw materials required to manufacture them, and for the patrons willing to purchase them. Maier was born in 1568 near Kiel on the northern border of the Holy Roman Empire, the son of a gold embroiderer (Goldsticker) in the service of Heinrich Rantzau (1526–1598), Governor of Schleswig-Holstein. Rantzau seems to have been an early patron of Maier’s, as well as an inspiration for his interest in Egypt as the font of the prisca sapientia. From 1587 Maier studied physics, mathematics, logic and astronomy at the University of Rostock; yet this first attempt to transcend his artisanal background came to nought, as he returned home without a degree four years later. In 1592 he defended some purely Galenic theses for his Master of Arts at Frankfurt an der Oder. There followed a period of three years’ medical training, during which Maier conducted his first laboratory experiments; however, at this point he was “unwilling to squander money” on the “dark and profound” art of alchemy. In 1595 he undertook a journey to the University of Padua, one of the foremost medical schools in Europe, where he acquired the title of Poet Laureate. Before a year had passed, however, he had fled in disgrace after wounding a fellow student. Despite the best efforts of the Paduan authorities, Maier managed to gain his doctorate at the University of Basel shortly thereafter.In the years immediately following his peregrinatio academica, Maier roamed the Hanseatic ports as a travelling vendor of Galenic remedies. During this period he claims to have become a “close acquaintance” of the famed astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), whom he met in Rostock and Hamburg; he also met the alchemist and Christian Cabalist Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605) while in Danzig, but he came to regard the man as a fraud (Betrüger). In December of 1601 Maier was to be found prescribing dried frogs in vinegar at the White Horse Inn in Danzig, but his sights were set upon a more lucrative business. His interest in alchemy had been piqued by the healing of a chronically ill man with an English aurum potabile (“potable gold,” a liquid or powdered form of the Philosophers’ Stone), and in 1603 he struck out along the trading route linking Danzig with the gold and silver mines of Hungarian Carpathia. Returning to his hometown near Kiel with the minerals he had acquired, he completed his first alchemical experiment at Easter, 1604.The pinnacle of Maier’s career was reached with his appointment as personal physician (Leibarzt) to Rudolf II — the melancholy emperor who felt he had been “bewitched,” such was his fascination with alchemy and occult philosophy. Maier had moved to Prague, the seat of the imperial court, at some time in 1608. The unique culture of pansophic humanist learning fostered there inspired his Arcana arcanissima (1614), the first comprehensive statement of Maier’s innovative hermeneutic paradigm: mythoalchemy, or the interpretation of Greek and Egyptian myths as ancient ciphers for alchemical processes.Despite gaining the prestigious title of Imperial Count Palatine, for reasons unknown Maier left Rudolf’s service in 1610. He subsequently gravitated towards the court of Landgrave Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, Germany’s foremost patron of alchemy, where the opportunity arose to investigate the English alchemical remedy he had first encountered in Danzig. Travelling to London, Maier met the infamous Francis Anthony (1550–1623), who for many years had been engaged in an acrimonious dispute with the College of Physicians concerning his aurum potabile. Maier defended his “good friend” in print, co-authoring Anthony’s Apologia veritatis illucescentis, pro auro potabili (1616), and when he returned to the continent in 1616, he took with him 200 Königsthaler worth of Anthony’s medicine in the hope of selling it at the annual Frankfurt Fair. But like Anthony before him, he was refused a license by the authorities — in this case by the city physician (Stadtarzt) of Frankfurt am Main, who personally testified to Maier’s inability to cure his patients with the aurum potabile.The Frankfurt Fair also provided an opportunity for Maier to sell his books, the majority of which were printed by the Frankfurt publishers Lucas Jennis and Johann Theodor de Bry; but in this enterprise, too, he failed to turn a profit. Despite his earlier attempts to secure the patronage of Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, Maier only gained a modest extra-mural position at the Hessian court in mid-1618, and this was revoked before his death. By 1619 he was living with his wife and children in Magdeburg, where his fortunes steadily declined amid the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis accompanying the early years of the Thirty Years’ War. In his desperation to procure raw materials for his aurum potabile (“red extract of common gold,” i.e. colloidal gold) and luna potabile (in all probability colloidal silver), Maier turned to his own wife’s pawned jewellery, as well as to debased coinage withdrawn from circulation. In this twilight of his career Maier also began to compose astrological, geomantic and medical tracts for Gebhardt Johann von Alvensleben (1576–1631), a noble landholder in the vicinity of Magdeburg; the unfinished Strategemata medica triaria included Paracelsian “white magical” remedies operating via the power of the imagination (vis imaginativa). Maier’s journey to Torgau to meet Paul Nagel (†1624), a Paracelsian chiliast who moved in the circles of both Jacob Böhme and the early Rosicrucians, provides another indication of this turn toward theologically equivocal arts.The end of Maier’s star-crossed quest for patronage came in 1622. Having produced an aurum potabile “far excelling” Anthony’s in efficacy, he set out for his native Holstein to deliver a sample to Duke Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf (1597–1659). Along the route home he stayed at Rostock, where he dedicated his Cantilenae intellectuales de phoenice redivivo to Duke Friedrich on 25 August 1622. However, he died before reaching Holstein, apparently from a chronic illness. Shortly thereafter bittersweet news arrived in Magdeburg: the King of Sweden (Gustav II Adolf, the Lutheran “Lion of the North”) was offering Maier free housing, upkeep and a salary of 2000 Reichsthaler in exchange for his services. Thus it seems Maier had been tantalizingly close to securing the kind of lucrative sponsorship for which he had vainly striven in the course of his itinerant and ultimately tragic life.","type":"essay"},{"id":"/front-matter/getacquainted/alchemy","title":"Early Modern Alchemy","author":"Jennifer M. Ramplingby Jennifer M. Rampling","body":"Alchemy was a novitas, a novelty, when it arrived in Christian Europe in the twelfth century. Known to the Latin West primarily from translations of Arabic texts, this new art taught how extraordinary physical transformations might be wrought through natural processes, harnessed by human ingenuity — specifically, by crafting a transmuting agent: the philosophers’ stone. While new to latinate readers, “alchemia” already had a long and multilingual history. In Greco-Roman Egypt, chemeia encompassed a variety of techniques for coloring substances: from dyeing wool purple, to tinging base metals gold or silver. In the Byzantine Empire, alchemy increasingly came to be associated with the transmutation of metals. Alchemists in the medieval Islamic lands developed an array of practices that related to medicine as well as metallurgy, within a theoretical armature influenced by the precepts of Greek and Arabic philosophy. Yet without the ancient pedigree of other, more securely-established fields of knowledge, such as geometry, medicine, and astrology, alchemy’s intellectual status in Christian Europe was initially uncertain. In making the case for alchemy as scientia — learned knowledge — rather than as a manual craft, its adherents adopted a variety of strategies. One was to invent authoritative founding figures, from Hermes Trismegistus, the legendary Egyptian sage, to ancient philosophers like Democritus, or Biblical authorities like Solomon. Another was to account for alchemical change using accepted philosophical and medical doctrines. In the thirteenth century, for instance, scholars sought to explain transmutation in terms of Aristotelian natural philosophy. In the sixteenth century, writers influenced by Renaissance humanism seized upon classical myth as a source of authority and a tool for interpretation. The rise of mechanical philosophies of matter over the next century brought atomist and corpuscular explanations to the fore, which in turn drew on earlier, medieval theories about the composition of metals. Alchemists were concerned with more than transmutation: they also sought to heal sickness and prolong life. During the 1350s, John of Rupescissa argued that the “quintessence,” a substance made by repeatedly distilling wine, represented a perfect balance of elements, capable of expelling sickness from human bodies. This notion, accompanied by growing practical interest in distilled remedies, influenced the development of chemical medicine during the sixteenth century: particularly through the interventions of the Swiss medical reformer Paracelsus (Theophrastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541), who proposed alchemy as a fundamental science of nature, and one imbued with profound religious significance. Alchemy’s diversity was reflected in its practitioners, who ranged from artisans, housewives, and merchants, to physicians, clerics, and natural philosophers. At the top of the early modern social ladder, alchemy also attracted princes and prelates, whose interest in the economic and political potential of alchemy frequently resulted in the licensing or financing of alchemical projects. The failure of several such enterprises in courtly settings cemented popular perceptions of alchemy as an art of deception, and its practitioners as fools or frauds. The need to reassure readers, convince sceptics, and impress prospective patrons contributed to some of the distinctive strategies employed in alchemical writing. Philosophically-oriented treatises offer instruction on the theory and practice of the science, often by setting out the sequence of operations necessary to produce the stone. Yet this advice typically obfuscates more than it explains. Vital information, including the identity of key ingredients, might be omitted, abbreviated, or disguised using fanciful cover names. By importing language and concepts from other fields of enquiry, including medicine, natural philosophy, and theology, writers also invoked powerful analogical relationships with the natural and divine worlds. The generation of the philosophers’ stone might be framed in terms of human or animal reproduction, while the putrefaction and perfection of base matter mapped conveniently onto Christian narratives of death and resurrection (fig. 1). Such strategies helped to both explain and justify alchemical procedures, while also preserving alchemy’s identity as a tradition of secret, privileged knowledge. Readers thus learned to approach alchemical texts and images as puzzles to be solved. Many seemingly obscure descriptions can in fact be “decoded” as recognizable chemical procedures. For instance, in Emblem 24 Maier shows the body of a king (representing gold, the “king” of metals) devoured by a wolf (stibnite, or antimony ore). Molten stibnite dissolves gold to form a gold-antimony alloy, causing any impurities to separate out. The antimony can then be driven off by strong heating, while the purified gold remains behind — depicted here by the resurrected king, emerging unscathed from the fire (fig. 2). A more complex scheme unfolds in the design of the “Ripley Scroll” (fig. 3): an emblematic roll embellished with English verses which was repeatedly copied throughout the sixteenth century. Here, the combination of metallic ingredients is represented as the coitus of male and female figures, the Sun and Moon (gold and silver). United by the philosophical mercury, this couple generates a child, the “soul” of metals. Yet the design also evokes themes from scripture and medieval romance, allowing us to situate its alchemical content within the broader context of late fifteenth-century England. The power of these analogies was not lost on painters, poets, and playwrights, who in turn incorporated the language of alchemy into literary and artistic works. Whether as a philosophical tradition, a body of practices, an entrepreneurial strategy, or an analogy for the relationship between nature and human art, alchemy was a powerful cultural force in early modern Europe.","type":"essay"},{"id":"/front-matter/getacquainted/printing","title":"Atalanta fugiens in the Printing Office","author":"Stephen Taborby Stephen Tabor","body":"Michael Maier’s Atalanta fugiens is a small tour de force of bookmaking that combines the specialized media of intaglio (copperplate etching) and typeset music with the more conventional — though still demanding — setting of texts in two languages using roman, italic, and black-letter types of various sizes. It is one of scores of elaborate illustrated works printed by Hieronymus Galler, many of them for the publisher Johann Theodor de Bry. The following introduction to the technical aspects of Maier’s book may serve to increase our appreciation for the labor that went into it. Atalanta fugiens, like the vast majority of books of its time, was printed on paper made by hand, sheet by sheet. (The process, as practiced in a traditional English papermill which, alas, closed in 1987, can be seen in the embedded video.) The paper used by Galler measured approximately 40 by 32 cm, four times the size of the finished book. Instead of cutting the sheets to size and printing them individually, Galler arranged his type in groups of four pages on each side of the sheet. With the correct layout, the finished sheets could be folded once in either direction (making a “French fold”), and the eight pages would come out in order. This common format was called a quarto; other possibilities included the larger folio (two pages to a side, four to a sheet), the smaller octavo (eight to a side, sixteen to a sheet), and so on down. These structures — called quires, signatures, or gatherings — provided folds for the binder to sew through, making a more durable construction than that produced by stabbing through individual leaves near their edges. Each copy of Atalanta fugiens contains 27 quires. To help keep them in order, the printer would give each one a letter of the alphabet. These can be seen at the bottom of some of the right-hand pages (the “rectos”). For instance, page 53 of the Atalanta bears the signature-mark “G3,” meaning it is the third leaf in quire G (fig. 1). The text was typeset by hand, about one metal letter per second. (The example above contains some examples of two letters cast on one body — the “æ” ligature in “quæ,” for example, and the “is” in “solis.” These helped to create a more calligraphic effect.) The music was set in the same way, note by note, each with its own section of staves. Figure 2 shows the gaps and discontinuities between the notes, characteristic of typeset music. Typesetting music was a specialized skill, particularly prone to typos, and it is possible that Galler subcontracted this part of the work to someone else. Even so, mistakes remain in the finished book. Figure 3 shows a printing press very like the one that would have been used by Galler. Although the quire (the sheet) was the structural unit of the book, Galler could only machine one side of the sheet at a time. The group of pages on the press at any one time was called a forme, and for the pressman this was the basic production unit. In the case of Maier’s quarto publication it consisted of four pages, and as you will see if you make a quire by folding a sheet of paper once in each direction, these pages were not continuous. Thus, the printer had to have his wits about him when arranging his pages to print. During the printing of a forme, a proofreader was usually at work. If he found errors, the press could be stopped and the type corrected; this process could repeat. The sheets already printed were not thrown away — the paper was half the cost of the book — so each sheet of the edition might have several correction states. When the sheets were collated to produce finished copies of the whole book, there was no compelling reason for early states of all the sheets to end up in the same copies. For this reason it is meaningless to speak of early or late “copies” of a hand-printed book; there are only early or late states of the individual formes. Figure 4 shows the Atalanta forme from quire O containing pages 105, 108, 109, and 112, as it came off of Galler’s press. We can immediately see that something is wrong here: the illustrations are missing. That is because they were created by a different process requiring a second production run on a different kind of press. The process, called intaglio, started with a polished copper plate. The plate was coated with a thin, acid-resistant layer, then the artist’s design was transferred to it; alternatively, the platemaker could work freehand from his model. (For Atalanta fugiens the artist was Matthäus Merian, although the plate was probably worked by one of his craftsman associates.) The platemaker used a sharp point to cut the design through the acid resist to the bare metal, then immersed the plate in an acid bath. The acid etched the design into shallow grooves; the process could be repeated to darken certain areas, or the platemaker could engrave stronger lines directly into the plate. Finally, the plate was cleared of the resist and printing could begin. Figure 5 shows an etched copperplate by Rembrandt, executed sixteen years after the Atalanta. Letterpress text is printed by inking the raised letter surfaces and pressing them into the paper. Intaglio is different: the printer coats the entire plate with ink, then polishes off the flat surface, leaving ink only in the crevices. For each plate in Atalanta fugiens, this process alone took several minutes. The plates were then set onto the blank spaces of the letterpress sheets and run through a rolling press, a steamroller sort of apparatus that produced immense pressure along a moving line to push the paper into the grooves of the plate and pick up the ink. Using foot-pressure helped to turn the rollers, and the impression of the metal plate’s edge is usually visible just outside the image on the printed page (fig. 6). For Atalanta fugiens, the words and music were printed in Galler’s shop, and then the sheets were transferred to a rolling press for completion (fig. 7). The example shown here went through the rolling press with two copperplates whose placement on the sheet was slightly crooked. Every copy of this sheet would be just a bit different in this regard, and if the plate printer’s mind was wandering, the illustrations might come out upside-down or interchanged. Aligning and registering the hollow rectangular copperplate border on the title page outside the already-printed letterpress text must have been particularly ticklish. Copies of the book are known with and without the portrait of a resolute Michael Maier on page 11. We don’t know the reason it appears in some copies and not others; perhaps the finished plate arrived too late to be printed in the earliest ones sold. We wouldn’t necessarily expect it to occur on the sheets with the latest correction state of the text, but this is a matter for further investigation. Atalanta fugiens was cleverly designed so that the difficult parts — the music and the illustrations — fall on only one of the two formes of each sheet, as figure 7 shows. The backing formes contain the straightforward texts of the Discursi, which by comparison were child’s play to produce. From Galler’s viewpoint it must have seemed almost like working on two separate books of very different complexities. All told, every copy of Atalanta fugiens represents 81 runs through a press — 82 for copies with the portrait. Multiply that number times the unknown number of copies in the edition, perhaps on the order of one thousand, and factor in a few other publications that Galler was probably working on simultaneously, and you get a feeling for the complexity of an early modern printing operation.","type":"essay"}]
