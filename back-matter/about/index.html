          <div class="content">
            <p>In 1618, on the eve of the Thirty Years War, the German alchemist and physician Michael Maier published <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, an intriguing and complex musical alchemical emblem book designed to engage the ear, eye, and intellect. The book unfolds as a series of fifty emblems, each of which contains a motto, a copperplate etching, an epigram in German and Latin, and an accompanying “fugue,” i.e., music scored for three voices. Each emblem/fugue set is followed by a Latin discourse in which Maier points to particular works from the alchemical corpus, providing bibliographic clues for the reader to use in unlocking the emblem’s hidden meaning. Historians of alchemy have long understood this virtuoso work as an ambitious demonstration of the art’s literary potential, an experiment with genre and the possibilities of the early modern printed book. More recently, scholars have noted that Maier’s emblems also encode actual laboratory materials and technologies, inviting us to revisit the book not only as a display of erudition and a paean to the philosophers’ stone but also as a puzzle, a tool that can be used to generate endless new insights into nature’s secrets.</p>
            <p><em>Atalanta fugiens</em> lends itself unusually well to experimentation with digital tools and technologies available today. Re-rendering Maier’s multimedia alchemical project as an enhanced online publication, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> allows contemporary readers to hear, see, manipulate, and investigate <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> in ways that were perhaps imagined when it was created yet impossible to fully realize before now. An interactive, layered digital edition provides accessibility and flexibility to readers, presenting all the elements of the original book along with significant enhancements that allow for deep engagement by specialists and non-specialists alike: a fully searchable English translation sourced from a seventeenth-century manuscript housed in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University; high resolution, zoomable images; newly commissioned, manipulable vocal recordings of <em>Atalanta</em>’s music; a downloadable performance edition featuring modernized musical notation; and a multifunctional space that allows users to curate, save, and share their own selection and arrangement of Maier’s emblems. <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> makes possible the playful capabilities implied by <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> while also enabling and encouraging new interpretations of this early modern emblem book. Three short, introductory essays invite readers to get acquainted with early modern alchemy, printing, and Michael Maier. Eight extended, interpretive essays explore <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and its place in the history of music, science, print, and visual culture in early modern Europe. These interdisciplinary essays include interactive features that clarify and/or advance the authors’ arguments while positioning <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> as an original, uniquely engaging contribution to our understanding of early modern culture.</p>
            <p>
          	The impetus for re-imagining <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a dynamic, multimodal publication came from two multidisciplinary, collaborative workshops that took an experimental approach to deciphering <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. The first was held in March 2015 at the Chemical Heritage Foundation (renamed the Science History Institute in 2018) in Philadelphia. This workshop brought together rare books curators as well as experts in history, music, mathematics, and digital humanities to puzzle out &mdash; and perform &mdash; Maier’s book. The new ideas, debates, and general excitement that emerged from this interactive engagement with Maier’s text became the springboard for <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>. A second workshop at Brown University followed, held on a very wintry weekend in February 2016. About forty international scholars, students, and musicians, snowbound on the Brown campus, gathered to discuss and demonstrate some of the ways in which innovative digital engagement with <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> might open up Maier’s world to a contemporary readership.

            	<em>Furnace and Fugue</em> was developed under the auspices of Brown University’s Digital Publications Initiative, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Additional support was provided by a Humanities Grant from The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, as well as a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award and a Seed/Bridge Grant from the Social Science Research Institute at Brown University.

            <h2>Editorial Practices</h2>
            <p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> makes use of a seventeenth-century English translation of Michael Maier's Latin text in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (1618). This translation, entitled "Atalanta running, that is, new chymicall emblems relating to the secrets of nature," is held in the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University (<a href="https://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Search/Results?lookfor=%22Mellon+MS+48%22&amp;type=CallNumber" target="_blank">Mellon MS 48</a>). <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> contains both a diplomatic transcription that retains all original spelling and grammatical features of the Beinecke manuscript as well as a normalized transcription that lightly modernizes the spelling into current American usage. Both are generated from a single transcription encoded using <a href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/" target="_blank">TEI</a> conventions. The following descriptions outline the editorial practices used throughout the digital edition.</p>
            <h5>Notes on English Translation Orthography</h5>
            <p>Orthography (original spelling and capitalization) and anacolutha (idiosyncratic sentence structure and punctuation) used by the Beinecke manuscript author in both the diplomatic and normalized versions have been retained, with exceptions being the use of <em>u</em> and <em>j</em>: words like <em>loue</em>, <em>haue</em>, and <em>jron</em> have been silently altered to <em>love</em>, <em>have</em>, and <em>iron</em> in the normalized transcription. Other cases of emendation in the normalized transcription include: deletion of extra letters (such as <em>e</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>n</em>), hence <em>seeke</em>, <em>hott</em>, and <em>runne</em> in the diplomatic text are modernized to <em>seek</em>, <em>hot</em>, and <em>run</em>; the modernization of spelling where necessary (e.g. <em>inclosed</em> becomes <em>enclosed</em>); and the expansion of contractions (<em>i'th</em> becomes <em>in the</em>, and coḿon is modernized to <em>common</em>).</p>
            <p>The diplomatic transcription retains diphthongs (specifically, the compound vowels <em>æ</em> and <em>œ</em>, e.g. <em>Præface</em> and <em>fœtus</em>); however, the normalized version either presents a modernization of the word itself (<em>Preface</em>) or separates the ligature (<em>foetus</em>). In the case of <em>cœlum</em> and <em>cœlestial</em>, the Beinecke author follows Maier's Latin spelling, but the word is rendered as <em>coelum</em> and <em>celestial</em> in the normalized text.</p>
            <h5>Notes on English Translation Authorial Insertions</h5>
            <p>Where the Beinecke author has struck out or replaced sentences or words in both the diplomatic and the normalized edition, deletions have been silently omitted. Additions are indicated with &lt;angle brackets&gt; in the diplomatic text and are silently emended in the normalized version. Some curious features of the manuscript merit attention. The Beinecke author has added non-sequential numbers in superscript to certain passages within "Atalanta running." This numbering system in the diplomatic text has been retained, and the sentence in the normalized version has simply been re-ordered. Also, the Beinecke MS features two sections where paper flaps have been pasted onto the page: one flap is affixed to the title page and another on p.103, at the end of Discourse 32, which appears to be the first four lines of an "alphabetarium." This flap is clipped in such a manner that some lines are truncated, and there is no text underneath this paper addition:</p>
            <blockquote>
              “Avoid all disputes as much as poss<br/>
              Beware of all unruly passions<br/>
              Crave the divine protection<br/>
              Demonstrate your care by improvem.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>Furthermore, please note that the Beinecke MS was written by a single copyist in secretary and italic hands; however, this manuscript also bears penciled marginal notes and underlined text that are likely twentieth-century additions—these pencil annotations have been included where they appear as marginal notes, but not the underlined text, and this later hand is not distinguished from the Beinecke manuscript author’s in either the diplomatic or normalized transcriptions in the digital edition.</p>
            <p>The Beinecke MS is a fascinating document in its own right and merits further research; however, the objective with <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is not to provide a study of the Beineike MS itself but rather to provide a reliable English translation of Maier’s Latin text. Curious readers of <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> are encouraged to view this document online at <a href="https://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4262893" target="_blank">https://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4262893</a>.</p>
            <h5>Notes on Latin and German Text</h5>
            <p>The Latin and German text transcribed from Maier’s 1618 is also available in a diplomatic and a normalized version in the Digital Edition. The diplomatic version retains all brevigraphs (<em>et, per, pro, quod, qui)</em> and abbreviations and indicates the few typographic errors. The use of “j” and “v” is retained as printed in the text and not regularized. Long s is silently transcribed as “s.” The normalized version expands brevigraphs and abbreviations and silently corrects any mistakes. The German mottos and epigrams are only displayed in a diplomatic version and retain the original spelling.</p>

              <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
              <p>The <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> web presence has been created using static page generators. All interactivity is handled on the client side using JavaScript and no server-side support is necessary after the site has been generated.</p>
              <p>The digital edition of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is compiled from transcriptions of the original book, a <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:698524/" target="_blank">copy</a> of which is held in the John Hay Library at Brown University, and a seventeenth-century English <a href="https://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4262893" target="_blank">translation</a> held at Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Both texts are encoded in XML using the <a href="https://tei-c.org/" target="_blank">TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)</a> schema. Detailed notes documenting the encoding conventions are included in the XML files available on the <a href="https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/atalanta-texts" target="_blank">GitHub</a> text repository. The encoded texts capture more features than were able to be displayed in the digital edition and are available for re-use. The digital edition of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is converted from XML source files to HTML with the in-house, custom-coded site generator system Furnace, which is written in Python and uses XSL as its template language. The scholarly essays were built with the static site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.</p>
              <p>The music notation was created with Sibelius and exported to <a href="https://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">MEI (Music Encoding Initiative)</a>, an XML schema for representing the physical and intellectual characteristics of musical documents, using the <a href="https://github.com/music-encoding/sibmei" target="_blank">Sibelius-to-MEI</a> plugin. Because MEI is a format that is easily manipulated, it was possible to use the Verovio music notation engraving library to generate a web-ready vector notation in SVG and to extract the timing information needed to align audio with the interactive music display.</p>
              <p>Indexing and display are handled by JavaScript libraries. Search functionality is provided by the <a href="https://lunrjs.com/" target="_blank">Lunr.js</a> library with custom-built functionality to provide the context of search hits in the search result view. The faceted image search functionality was also built in-house. The digital edition uses <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSeadragon</a> for the zooming image viewer and <a href="https://github.com/VoidVolker/MagickSlicer" target="_blank">MagickSlicer</a> to create the image tiles. Additional animated effects and transitions in the digital edition, faceted image search, navigation menus, and interactive map use the <a href="https://greensock.com/" target="_blank">GreenSock Animation API (GSAP)</a>, the <a href="https://greensock.com/ScrollToPlugin" target="_blank">GSAP ScrollToPlugin</a>, <a href="https://scrollmagic.io/" target="_blank">ScrollMagic</a>, and Tumult Hype Pro and the <a href="https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints" target="_blank">Waypoints JavaScript library</a>, respectively. Detailed documentation on implementation can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/atalanta-media" target="_blank">GitHub</a> code repository.</p>

            <h2>Author Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>It took many people to create <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, from its named author Michael Maier, to the printers, funders, and artisans who produced books for the De Bry publishing firm, to the unacknowledged sources of Maier’s ideas, images, and music. Although Tara Nummedal and Donna Bilak’s names appear as co-editors, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> also required many hands and minds to bring it to fruition, and they wish to acknowledge that community here.</p>
            <p>The project emerged out of Donna Bilak’s postdoctoral research, which provided momentum for re-imagining <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a born-digital publication in two multidisciplinary, collaborative, and experimental workshops. The first was held in March 2015 at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia (renamed the Science History Institute in 2018). Organized by Bilak with support from Ronald Brashear, this workshop convened a group of performers, rare books curators, and scholars of history, music, mathematics, and digital humanities to puzzle out—and perform—Maier’s book. Instead of formal papers, it presented a hands-on approach to exploring <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, with emphasis on real-time conversation and debate, observation, and playfulness. Two extraordinary days followed, featuring fugues sung on demand and Latin epigram recitals. One participant created playing cards of the emblems to experiment with the formation of different kinds of pairings, another held an impromptu Rare Books School session to explain the physical aspects of Maier’s book, and the workshop culminated with a truly magical moment, when participants gathered around four copies of Maier’s book on loan from neighbouring institutions and sang music from <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> guided by the singers in the Othmer Library. Special thanks to “Team Atalanta”—Robin Bier and Graham Bier, Eric Bianchi, Ronald Brashear, Brian D. Hadley, Peter Forshaw, Giuseppe Gerbino, Mary E. Larew, Loren Ludwig, Molly Netter, Ridge Montes, Lawrence M. Principe, Jennifer M. Rampling, Pamela H. Smith, Stephen Tabor, James R. Voelkel, and Lee Zickel. Workshop conversation was further enriched by the participation of Caroline Duroselle-Melish, Stefano Gattei, Ben Gross, Lynne Farrington, Juan Andreas Leon, Esther Ritman, and Julia Stone, with loans of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> copies from the University of Pennsylvania Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the University of Delaware Library, and the Augustus C. Long Health Sciences Library at Columbia University. Nummedal and Bilak are indebted to Ronald Brashear, whose auspices as the Othmer Library Director brought this first workshop into being, as the new ideas, debates, and general excitement that emerged from this interactive engagement with Maier’s text became the springboard for <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>.</p>
            <p>A second experimental workshop at Brown University followed, held on a very wintry weekend in February 2016, and was made possible through the generous funding of the Brown University Humanities Teaching and Research Fund, Renaissance and Early Modern Studies, History Department, and the University Library. About forty international scholars, students, and musicians, snowbound on the Brown campus, gathered to discuss and demonstrate some of the ways in which innovative digital engagement with <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> might open up Maier’s world to a contemporary readership. Several of the participants from the 2015 workshop continued the conversation begun in Philadelphia. The lead authors particularly wish to thank Evelyn Lincoln for co-organizing the event, Les Canards Chantants, directed by Robin Bier and Graham Bier, and Ridge Montes for bringing the book to life with an enchanting performance-lecture that weekend, as well as Rachel Berwick, Adam Borrego, Harold Cook, Caroline Duroselle-Melish, Elina Hamilton, Nori Jacoby, Gigi Michael, Iris Montero, Emily Monty, Vivian Morgowicz, Jeremy Mumford, the late Janice Neri, Jacob Perry, Jocelyne Prince, Michael Putnam, Alisha Rankin, Carmel Raz, Neil Safier, William Sherman, Pamela Smith, Andrew Sparling, Beatrice Steiner, Alex Vidmar, and Lee Zickel for their deep and various expertise, open minds, collaborative spirit, and critical questions at such a crucial stage.</p>
            <p>The lead authors have shared ongoing research on <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> and <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> over the past few years, and have benefited enormously from the engagement of audiences at the Bard Graduate Center, Boston College, Charles University (Prague), Columbia University, European University Institute (Florence), the University of Cambridge, and the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. Bilak’s research into <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> first received support in 2013 from The Huntington Library as a Dibner Research Fellow in the History of Science and Technology, and her magic square idea took shape as the 2013-14 Sidney M. Edelstein Fellow at (what is now known as) the Science History Institute. The essay ultimately came together at the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America as an Associate Research Scholar in 2017-18, and Bilak is especially indebted to Ann-Sophie Barwich and Eric Bianchi for their incisive critiques of final drafts. Nummedal developed her essay in this volume in 2017 while in residence as a Visiting Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (Berlin), Department II, where her colleagues pushed her to think more deeply about music, the history of the book, and the history of the senses in connection with the history of science.</p>
            <p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> was also the beneficiary of fortuitous timing. Just as plans began to come into focus around a digital presentation of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Brown University launched its Digital Publications Initiative, generously supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This Initiative, designed to explore the possibilities of rigorous, scholarly, digital publication, immediately seemed like the right home for <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>, and the lead authors feel immensely fortunate that this book has been nurtured by the intellectual vision, imagination, resources, and expertise in Brown University Library’s Center for Digital Scholarship. Additional support for the music recordings was provided by a Humanities Grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation as well as by a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award and a Seed/Bridge Grant from the Social Science Research Institute at Brown University.</p>
            <p>Nummedal and Bilak are sincerely grateful to former Brown University Librarian Harriette Hemmasi and Dean of the Faculty Kevin McLaughlin for their early faith in and support for <em>Furnace and Fugue,</em> to Joukowsky Family University Librarian Joseph Meisel for recognizing its potential and helping to see it through to completion, and to the entire team at Brown—especially Adam Bradley, Crystal Brusch, Elli Mylonas, Patrick Rashleigh, Ben Tyler, and Dashiell Wasserman—and to Studio Rainwater, not only for their expertise and experience but also for developing <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> with them (not for them). The lead authors owe a special thanks to Loren Ludwig, who not only authored one of the essays, but also so expertly coordinated the music recordings that are at the heart of <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>. Most of all, they are deeply indebted to Digital Scholarship Editor Allison Levy, who brought her own expertise in publication and early modern Europe to the project and whose steady hand kept <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>, with all of its collaborators and moving parts, on track.</p>
            <p>[NOTE: add UVA acknowledgments here]</p>
            <p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> not only presents an important model for scholarly collaborations that cross disciplines, but it also reflects professional diversity within the academy. Such work shows how a postdoc and a tenured professor, working at different institutions, could combine access to scholarly communities and funding to create a rich, multi-disciplinary project that would not have been possible if undertaken individually. Still, Nummedal and Bilak each have their own personal acknowledgments in addition to these collective ones.</p>
            <p>Tara Nummedal wishes to thank Donna Bilak, above all, for rekindling her interest in Michael Maier and <em>Atalanta fugiens,</em> for being the creative force behind this project from the outset, and for making a community out of a seventeenth-century book. Nummedal would also like to acknowledge the late Janice Neri, who taught her so much about the role of images in constituting knowledge, both with her own scholarship and in the 2016 workshop at Brown. Special thanks to Seth Rockman and Mila Rockedal for their willingness to open the family home to scholars and musicians. Finally, Nummedal wishes to thank her undergraduate and graduate students at Brown. Their intellectual curiosity, interdisciplinary inclinations, talent, and creativity truly are an inspiration, and she hopes they continue to puzzle through ideas in whatever they go on to do.</p>
            <p>Finally, Donna Bilak wishes to extend personal and sincere thanks to the scholars and performers whose expertise, insights, and imagination opened her up to amazing new facets of Atalantaland: Robin and Graham Bier, Anna Conser, Brian Hadley, Loren Ludwig, Ridge Montes, Zea Morvitz, and Anthony Parenti. Special thanks goes to Bilak’s collaborator, Tara Nummedal, for taking a chance with her—and to Ron Brashear, in many ways the godfather of <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>, for ensuring this project had a chance to come into being.</p>
