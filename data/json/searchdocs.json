I answer, Chymically, it is Sulphur, which is carried in Argent vive, as Lully in his book, Chapt 32 attests, and all the Lully there. The wind carries him in his belly, that is, Sulphur is carried in ☿. and Chap. 47. The Stone is fire carried in the belly of aire. . . . . rest; physically, it is an infant, which ought in a little time to be born into the world: I say also Arithmetically, that it is the root of a Cube; Musically, that it is the Disdiapason; Geometrically, that it is a punctum the beginning of a running line; Astronomically, the center of the planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars: though these be different subjects, yet if they be well compared together, they will easily demonstrate the offspring of wind, which must be left to every mans industry more or less. But I indigitate the matter more plainly thus: every Mercury is compounded of fumes, that is, of water elevating earth with it into an airy rarity, and of earth forcing air to return into a watery earth or earthy water: for the Elements being altogether in it, and mixed, and subdued and reduced together into a viscous nature, they do not easily recede one from the other,1 but 3either 5the 6volatile 2do 4follow 7above, 8or remain below with the fixed, the first whereof is evident in common Mercury, the other in the Philosophical and fixed metals: in these the fixed Elements do predominate over the volatile, in ^that the volatile oversway the fixed: nor indeed is it without reason, that Mercury is called and reputed the messenger, interpreter, and as it were the running intermediate minister of the other Gods, with wings fitted to his head and feet: for he is windy, and flies through the air as wind itself, as is commonly and really confirmed to the damage of many men; but carrying a white wand girt with two Serpents crosswise, which can draw souls out of bodies, and bring them back again, and do many such contrary things, he exquisitely represents the Philosophical Mercury. Mercury therefore is wind, which takes Sulphur or Dionysius, or, if you had rather, Aesculapius, beging yet an imperfect Embryo, out of the mothers belly, or even outbecomes Volatile of the ashes of the mothers body burned, and carries it thither, where it may be matured; and the Embryo is Sulphur, which is infused into digested & fix'd the belly of Boreas by the celestial Sun, that he may bring it forth being matured, who in the complete time of his carriage producesthe White & reddish or 🜍 twins, one with white hair, called Calais, the other with red, namedx a Zethe: these Sons of Boreas were (as Orpheus the Chymical poet writes) 10 with Jason among the Argonauts to carry away the golden fleece from Colchos: and Phineus the blind Prophet, infested by the Harpies, could not beBlack freed, but by the said sons of Boreas, for which benefit obtained from them, he, being grateful, declared the whole manner of the way to the Argonauts: But the Harpies are no other, than corrupting Sulphur, which is driven away by the sons of Boreas, having attained to full age, and of a thing imperfect or molested with noxious birds is made perfect, not subject to that evil, which then shows to Jason the Physician the way to obtain the golden fleece. These winds our countryman Basill amongst others also takes notice of, and plainly says: A doublewind ought to arise;absurdly described called Vulturnus, and ; then a single wind, called Notus, which willblowNaaman comes from the north from the East and South impetuously, whose motion ceasing, so as water to be made of air, you willconfidently believe, that a corporal thing will be made of a spiritual. And Ripley gate 8. says, that our Infant ought to be born again in air, that is, in the belly of wind: Says Scala Philosophorum, degree 6. after the same sense thus: You must know that the Son of the wise is born in the air: and degree 8: Airy Spirits ascending together into the air do love =one another, as Hermes says, the wind carried him in its belly: because the generation of our Son is made in the air, and being born in the air is born wisely: for he ascends from earth to heaven, and again descends to earth acquiring both the superior and inferior virtue. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem02.html","doctitle":"Emblem 2","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA II. in Quinta, infra.Sein Saugmutter ist die Erden.","epigram-de":"II.

A courteous Wolf to Romulus displayed Her milky duggs, to Jove a Goat, tis said: Nor is it strange to assert our mother Earth Gave suck to th' tender Philosophic birth; If beasts so small Heroes so great could breed, How great will he be, whom the earth doth feed?","discourse-en":"Discourse 2. It is concluded by the Peripatetics, and Orthodox Philosophers, that the thing nourishing is converted into the substance of the thing nourished, and assimilated to it, not indeed before, but after the alteration of it, and that is accounted an infallible axiom: for how would the thing nourishing (which is allready before the like and the same with the thing nourished) have need of the mutation of its essence, which if it should happen, it would not remain the same nor the like; or how should those things, which cannot be assimilated to the thing nourished, be taken for nutriment, such as are wood, stones and the like? as therefore the first is vain, so the other is contrary to nature; but for an Infant new born to be nourished by the milk of animals, is a thing not repugnant to nature: because assimilation of it may be made, but far more easily of the mothers, than of anothers: wherefore Physicians do conclude, that it conduces to the health, similitude of substance and manners, as also strength of an Infant, if it be always nourished by the milk of its own mother, on the contrary if by anothers. This is the harmony of every nature, that like delights in its like, and follows its footsteps, so far as it is able, in all things, with a certain tacit consent and conspiration: the same thing usually happens in the natural work of the Philosophers, which is equally governed by nature in the conformation of it, as an infant in the mothers womb; and though a father and mother, and nurse be by way of similitude ascribed to it, yet it is not more artificial, than the generation of every animal: two seeds are by a certain pleasant artifice joined together by animals, and both human sexes, which being united do by successive alteration produce an Embryo, which grows and is increased, acquires life and motion, and then is nourished by milk: but necessary it is for the woman in time of conception and impregnation to carry herself temperately in heat, meat and drink, motion and rest, and other circumstances, otherwise an abortion will follow, and destruction of the conceived Embryo, which observation in six things not natural, because it is prescribed by Physicians according to their art, is also artificial. After the same manner if the seeds be not joyned together in the Philosophical work, they ought to be joined: but if they could be found somewhere joined together, as the seed of the Cock and Hen are had in an egg subsisting together in one continent, then would the Philosophers work be yet more natural, than the generation of animals. But let us grant, as the Philosophers do assert, that one comes from the east and another from the west, and are made one, what more is administered to them, than mixtion in their own vessel, temperate heat and nutriment? the vessel is indeed artificial, but herein is no difference, whether the nest be made by the Hen herself, or disposed by a country dame in some certain place, as common it is, the generation of the eggs, and the hatching of chickens from them will be the same. Heat is a natural thing, whether it proceed from the temperate fire of furnaces, and putrefaction of dung, or from the Sun and air, or bowels of the mother, or elsewhere: thus the Egyptian doth by art administer 13 natural heat by his furnaces for the hatching of eggs: the Seeds of silkworms, yea even hen eggs are said to be hatched by the warmth of a Virgins breasts: Art therefore and Nature do mutually help, so as to officiate one for the other: nevertheless nature is always the Mistress, and Art the servant. But to say the earth is the Nurse of the Philosophical babe, might create an objection to any one, the earth being of all the elements most dry and void of juice, to which siccity as the proper quality appertains: but it may be answered, that the earth elemented is here understood, not the Element, which we took notice enough of in the first day of the Philosophical week, and explained nature: This (earth) is the nurse of Cælum, not in opening, washing or watering the babe, but coagulating, fixing and colouring, and converting it into mere juice and blood: For nutrition implies augmentation in length, breadth, and depth, that is, extending itself through all dimensions of the body, which being here, and performed by earth alone to the Philosophical babe, the name of nurse is not without reason to be ascribed to earth: but a thing contrary to the other kinds of milk, which are converted and do not convert, happens in this admirable terrestrial juice, it by reason of its most efficacious virtue much altering the nature of the thing nourished, even as the milk of the wolf is believed to have disposed the body of Romulus into a magnanimous nature, and propense to war. . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem03.html","doctitle":"Emblem 3","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA III in Quarta, infra.

If any impurities happen to linen clothes, whereby they are spotted and black, as with earthy recrements, they are washed away by the next Element, namely water, and the clothes exposed to the air, that the moisture together with the feces may be drawn out by the heat of the Sun, as by fire, the fourth Element, if this be often done the clothes, which before were foul and unclean, do become pure, and free from Spots: This is the art of women, which they learned from Nature herself: for we see, that if the bones of animals, which at first are black and filthy, be exposed to the air, and often washed with rain, and dried again by the heat of the Sun often coming upon them, they will, as Isaac notes, be reduced to perfect whiteness: The same also were observed in the Philosophical subject, whatsoever crudities and feces appear, they are purged and taken away by waters poured on, and the body brought to great clarity and perfection. For all Chymical operations, as Calcination, Sublimation, Solution, Distillation, Descension, Coagulation, Fixation, and the rest, are perfected by ablution alone: For he that washes an impure thing with water, performs the same thing, as is accomplished by so many forms of operating: For, as the Philosophers Rosary says, the linen of prince Duenech being defiled by sweat, must be washed by fire, and burned by water: by which fire and water seem to have given one another mutual qualities, or that the Philosophical fire is not of the same kind with common fire, and the same must be supposed of the water. As for Calx vive, and ignis Græcus we know that they are kindled by water, and no wise extinguished, contrary to the nature of other things that are subject to take fire: so they affirm that Camphore being kindled before burnes in water: and the Stone called Gagates (as Ansell de Bood attests) being kindled is more easily extinguished by oil than water: for Oil is mixed with it, and suffocates the fired body: water not being able to mix itself with fatness, gives place to the body being fired, unless it altogether cover and overwhelm it: but that cannot easily be done, because it is a stone, and swims upon the top of the water, as all oil: So Naphta, Petroleum, and the like being kindled do not much fear water. Some write of the Subterranean coals in the dominion of Liege, that being kindled in the earth, they cannot be extinguished by water, but only by throwing and heaping the dust of the earth upon them: as Cor: Tacitus declares of the like kind of fire, which cannot be quenched by water, but only by clubs, and garments taken off from the body: there is therefore a great diversity of 1fires, 8and 9no 10less 11of 12liquors, 2both 3in 4exciting 5and 6in 7extinguishing, 13because milk, vinegar, Spirit of wine, Aqua fortis, aqua Regia, and common water do differ much one from another, as to comparison with fire: nor this only, but also the matter itself does sometimes sustain fire, as those fine Byssinian clothes, formerly used and esteemed by rich men, which were washed, or reduced to former cleanness, by fire, not by water, the feces being burned away: Whatsoever some men vainly talk of the hairs of the reptile Salamander, as if incombustible 16 Elychnia or lamp wicks may be made thereof, is not to be regarded: Some there be who of a truth affirm that in times past a texture was prepared of Talc, plumous Alum, and such other matters, which was frequently purged by fire, but that the art was lost and extinct with the artist (a woman of Antwerp) through envy, and that the same temperament could not be found afterwards: We do not here speak of combustible matters: The Philosophical Subject must be considered according to all these differences, if at any time it be prepared: for fire, water, and matter itself is here not common: for the Philosophers fire is water, and water fire: their water does at once both wash and calcine, so also their fire: and the clothes which are to be washed have the nature of the byssinean textures, or prepared Talc, the temperament of which, and art of preparation is also not obvious to all men: To wash them, they make a Lixivium, or Lye, not with the ashes, or Salt of Oaks, but metallic, which is more durable than the other, nor with common water, but that, which has been congealed into Ice and Snow under the sign Aquarius, as that which is of thinner parts, than standing waters of ditches or Marshes, and therefore can better penetrate into the more internal parts of the black and unclean Philsophical body, in order to the washing and purging thereof. . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem04.html","doctitle":"Emblem 4","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA IV. in Quarta, supra.

The divine and political laws do both forbid those people to marry, who are by nature joined in too near a degree of consanguinity, such namely as directly ascend and descend in a genealogical line, and that for very good considerations; but when the Philosophers speak of the mother to be joined with the Son, or father with the daughter, or of the brother with the Sister, they neither say or do anything contrary to the said laws: because subjects distinguish attributes and causes effects; for the persons of Philosophers are as free from those differences as the Sons and daughters of Adam, who married one with another without the imputation of any crime: but the principal reason seems to be, that mankind might be more firmly united and linked in affinity and friendship, and not divided into inimical and hereditary factions of families: the same reason remaining firm and entire in the first Sons and daughters of Adam, did not as all debar them from the rites of matrimony: for mankind did then exist inrites them alone, and no others were living besides them, and their parents, and therefore as allied in blood, so necessarily were they joined in affinity: but a multitude of men increasing, and being distributed into innumerable families, this was found a true and just cause why brothers Should not marry Sisters: The Philosophers have another reason, why Sisters may marry brothers, namely the similitude of substance, that it may be joined to the like: but in this kind there are onely two like one another as to species, different as to sex, whereof one is saluted by the name of brother, the other of sister: they therefore may be the same both liberty and condition, yea and inevitable necessity, as the first consanguine men, be lawfully committed to one matrimony: the brother is hot and dry, and therefore very choleric; the Sister is cold and moist, having much phlegmatic matter in her: which natures so differing in temper do commonly best agree in love and fruitfulness, and the propagation of Children: for as fire, which may be propagated, is not easily struck out of the most hard body Steel and Steel, nor out of the brittle flint and flint, but out of hard and brittle, that is, steel and flint, so a lively offspring is not produced from a hot man and fiery woman, as neither from both cold (for the coldness of the man is barrenness) but from him hot, her more cold, for, in the latitude of human temperament, the hottest woman is concluded colder than the coldest man of his sex, if sound, as Lev. Lemnius in lib. de occ. nat. mirac. proves: the Sister therefore and brother are rightly joined together by the Philosophers: If a man defines offspring from a hen, bitch, She goat, Ewe, or other brutes, he joins a cock, dog, he goat, ram, every animal to its Species, to which it is most like, and so is not frustrated of his desire; nor indeed does he respect the consanguinity of brutes, but only the generosity of every one, and the congruity of nature: So may it be said of the body of a tree, and the slip to be therein grafted, yea of the metallicke 19 nature, which notwithstanding as it has of all things the greatest similitude and homogeneity of substance, does so require, where it desires a thing to be joined with it: But brother and Sister being joined together, do not become fruitful, nor persist long in love, except a Philothesium, or cup of love be administered to them like an amorous potion: for their minds are hereby so quieted and united, that (laying aside modesty) they do as it were drunk (like Lot) go together, and procreate an offspring (not spurious but) legitimate: For who knows not that mankind is very much obliged to medicine, because many thousands of men are now in the world, which would not have been, if their fathers or forefathers had not by the means and benefit thereof been freed and delivered from the defect of sterility, or their mothers preserved from abortion, by removing and taking away the cause, or the nearest, and remote impediment? This cup of love is therfore given to this new married couple for the same reasons, which any man may hereby plainly understand are three, that is to say, constancy of love, remotion of sterility, and prevention of abortion . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem05.html","doctitle":"Emblem 5","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA V. in Quinta, supra.

Sed hîc contrarium accidit: quis bu-fo non os, sed mammam mulieris occupat, cujus lacte adeò incre-scit, ut ingentis magnitudinis roboris evadat: Mulier verò viri-bus absumptis extabescat moriatur: Venenum enim facilè per 31 DISCURSUS V. venas pectorales communicatur cordi, idq́ue inficit extinguit, Theophilus in turba meminit draconis mulieri juncti. quemadmodum ex Cleopatrae casu constat, quae viperas mammis admovit, cùm voluntariâ morte praeveniri voluerit, ne viva in vi-ctorum manus ac triumphos traheretur.

Ominosum sanè quid est, bufonem ex muliere nasci, quod aliàs contigisse novimus: Guilielmus Novobrigensis, Anglicus scri-ptor, in suis commentariis scribit (quàm fideliter, alii judicent) in lapicidina quadam ditionis Vintoniensis Episcopi, cùm lapis qui-dam magnus divideretur, intùs inventum bufonem vivum cum aurea cathena, eúmque ex Episcopi jussu eodem loci reconditum perpetuis tenebris immersum, ne quid mali ominis secum porta-ret: Talis est hic bufo: Auro enim insignis est, etiamsi non extrin-secùs, artificiali cathenae opere, tamen intrinsecùs naturali, nempe lapidis, quem alii Boracem, Chelonitin, Batrachiten, Crapaudi-nam aut garatronium vocant.

The whole troop of Philosophers do herein consent, that their work is nothing else, but man and wife: the mans part is indeed to generate, and govern the wife, hers to conceive, be impregnated, bring forth, give suck, and educate the offspring, and be subject to the mans command: for as She sustains and nourishes the conceived Embryo, before it be brought to light, with blood, so being brought forth with milk. To this end Nature has prepared for the tender infant a digestible and proportioned food in the mothers breasts, which waits his coming, as the first provision and viaticum in this race of the world: by milk therefore he is nourished, grows, and is increased, till he be furnished with instruments to chaw bread, that is, teeth, then is he deservedly weaned, because nature has provided him other nutriment more solid: But here the Philosophers say, that a Toad must be put to the womans breasts, that She may nourish it, as an infant, with her milk: This is a miserable and horrible spectacle, yea and a wicked thing, that milk designed for an infant Should be given to a Toad, being a venomous beast, and contrary to the nature of man: We have heard and read of Serpents and Dragons sucking the teats of Cows: Toads might perhaps desire the same thing, if occasion Should be offered in beasts. There is a noted story of a Toad, who seated himself upon the mouth, and inside of the lips of a certain countryman being asleep, so that he could not be driven off by any contrivance, unless by violence, which being accompanied with danger of death, by the spitting of poison (which he is said to use for defensive or offensive weapons) was therefore not to be attempted; but a remedy being found for the miserable man by antipathy, namely, of a very great Spider and the Toad, who hate one another mortally, he was therefore carried with the Toad directly to the place, where an overgrown Spider had made its webs, which seeing the Toad, presently came down upon the back of the Toad, and pricked him with its sting: but he having received no harm thereby, it descended a second time, and struck him again more strongly, whereupon the Toad began immediately to swell, and fell down dead from the mans mouth, without any hurt to him. But here a thing contrary happens, because the Toad seizes not the mouth but the breast of the woman, by whose milk he increases so as to be of great magnitude and strength, but the woman consumes and dies her spirits being taken away: for poison is easily communicated by the pectoral veins to the heart, and corrupts and destroys it, as it is evident in the case of Cleopatra, who applied Vipers to her breasts, being willing to be prevented by voTheophilus in Turba makes mention of a Dragon joined to a woman.-luntary death from being led alive into the hands and triumphs of the conquerors: But lest any man should think the Philosophers so cruel, as to enjoin a venomous reptile to be put to a woman, he must know that this Toad is the offspring or Son of the same woman, produced by a monstrous birth, and therefore by natural right ought to be fed and nourished by the mothers milk, but it is not in the will of the Son that the mother should die: for neither could he infect his mother, who was coagulated in her bowels, and increased by blood even to birth. It is indeed a thing ominous for a Toad to be born of a woman, which in our knowledge has happened elsewhere: 22 Guilielmus Novobrigensis, an English writer, in his commentaries says (how truly let others judge) that in a certain Stonequarry in the Diocesse of the Bishop of Winchester, a great stone being divided, there was within found a living Toad with a golden chain, and it was by the Bishops command hidden in the same place, and buried in perpetual darkness, lest it might bear an ill omen with it: Such is also this Toad: for it is appareled with gold, though not extrinsically, with the artificial work of a chain, yet intrinsically with a natural, namely of a Stone, which some call Borax, Chelonitis, Batrachites, Crapaudina, or Garatronium: for this far excels gold in virtue against all poisons whatsoever of animals, and is commonly set in gold, as a case or cover, that it may not be hurt or lost. But it ought to be legitimate being had out of ananimal, but if it be picked out of subterranean trenches, as commonly it is, the Stone taken up may be made neat in the form of it, and used instead thereof with the best minerals, relieving and comforting the heart: for here in is the Philosophical Toad really found, not in a Stonequarry (as that fabler affirms) and has gold in him, not outwardly for pomp: for to what end should a Toad adorn himself, lurking in darkness and secret places? that he might perhaps be magnificently saluted by a Beetle, if it met him in the twilight? what subterranean Goldsmith should make him a golden chain? the father perhaps of the green boys, which came out of the land of St Martin, yea out of the earth itself, as also two dogs out of the Stonequarry, asserted by the same Author? . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem06.html","doctitle":"Emblem 6","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA VI. in Quarta, infra.

A City says Plato subsists not by Physician and Physician, but by Physician and husbandman, that is, men of diverse functions, but he mentions the Husbandman and Physician first, because their works are very conspicuous in the imitation, emendation, and perfection of nature: for they both take a natural subject, in which they according to art add some certain things necessary being wanting, or also remove those things which are superfluous: so that the art of both may (as medicine by Hippocrates) be defined by the addition of defect, and subtracttion of superfluity: for what does the Husbandman more than add ploughing, ridging furrowing, harrowing, dunging or manuring, sowing, etc. to land left by nature, that is, commit the increase and good success to nature, which administers the heat of the Sun, and rain, and multiplies the seeds by them, and promotes them to standing corn soon after to be reaped: in the mean time whilst the herb is Springing the husbandman weeds out thistles and all impediments, gathers the corn being ripe, takes away things superfluous from it being reaped, namely, straw, chaff, and such other things: So also a Physician (as also a Chymist in a different respect) teaches how to preserve present health to mans body, being wanting to recover it by several remedies, takes away the morbific cause, cures the disease, assuages symptoms, abates superfluous blood by opening a vein, being wanting restores it by appointing good order of diet, evacuaates noxious humors by purgation, and so imitates, supplies, and amends nature a thousand ways by the works of the understanding and art; which being notorious, Chymical things are rather to be considered by us: for Chymistry does first declare the operations of agriculture by its secret bounds and ways of operating: Husbandmen have land, wherein to sow seed, so also the Chymists: They have dung wherewith to manure their ground, so also these, without which nothing could be done, nor any successe expected: They have seed, the multiplication of which they desire: if Chymists had not the like, they would (as Lully says) imitate the painter, that endeavors to express the face of a certain man, whom he had never seen, nor the image of him: Husbandmen expect rain, and heat of the Sun, so also do the Chymists truly administer heat convenient to their work, and rain: I need say no more: X Chymistry is exactly parallell to agriculture, and its deputy, which in all things expresses its offices, but under a most absolute allegory------------From hence the Ancients produced Ceres, Triptolemus, Osiris, Dionysus, the golden Gods, as relating to Chymistry, teaching as it were men how to cast the seeds of fruits into their earth, showing tillage, with the propagation of vines, and use of wine, all which things the ignorant have interpreted to rustical operations, but erroneously: for those things, which are absconded from the vulgar, and declared to the Learned under these veils of agriculture, are most abstruse mysteries of nature: To this end say the Philosophers that their gold must be sowed upon white foliated earth, as if they meant that the Sowing of corn Should be observed and imitated for example, which the author of the trea ?tise of corn and Jodoc. Greverus have most excellently performed in their descriptions, for they have both most elegantly accommodated every operation of agriculture in the producing of corn to the semination of gold, or generation of 25 the tincture: White earth, because sandy, yields little fruit to the countrymen, by whom that which is black and fat is more desired, but the white principally conduces to the Philosophers, if it be foliated, that is well prepared, because they know how to enrich it with their dung, the other not at all: Now sowing is the propagation of the world, whereby that, which cannot long endure in an individual, is caused to persist in the Species: This is in man, animals, and plants, in these hermaphroditically, in them under two distinct sexes: but in metals far otherwise: for in them a line is made of the flux of a point, a superficies of the flux of a line, a body of the flux of a superficies: But the Stars produced that point before the line, superficies, and body, because it is the principle of them all: Nature added the flux a long time after, that is, the celestial Sun did in the earth generate a Son, whom Mercury committed to Vulcan and Chiron to be educated, that is, to manual artifice, to be instructed, even as they write of Achilles, who was held and hardened in fire by his mother Thetys: he, amongst other things, learned Music, and the art of playing on the For this reason says Ovid. Phyllirides made the youth Achilles an excellent Harper. . . . Harp from Chiron: but Achilles being no other than the Philosophical subject ( whose Son was was Pyrrhus with red hair, without which two Troy could not be taken and subdued, as we have abundantly demonstrated in our Hieroglyphics booke 6.) therefore do we not without reason touch (though cursorily) upon Music in this our work, where we describe Achilles, and his heroic virtues and enterprises: For if Music adorned so great a Hero, why may it not also make this our work more complete and acceptable: For the Angels sing (as the sacred scriptures attest), the heavens sing, as Pythagoras affirms, and, as the Psalmist says, declare the glory of God, the Muses and Apollo sing, as the Poets, men even infants sing, birds sing, Sheep and geese sing in musical instruments, if therefore we also sing, there is reason for it . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem07.html","doctitle":"Emblem 7","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA VII. in 3. seu 10. supra.

What Hippocrates, the defender and propugnator of Physicians, affirms of humors, that they are different and many in man, and not one only, otherwise various diseases could not arise, that we perceive to be true of the elements of the world: for if there was but one only element, there could be no mutation of it into another, no generation nor corruption, yea all things would be one immutable thing, and no meteors, minerals, plants, and animals could be naturally from thence produced. For this reason the supreme Creator composed the whole system of this world of diverse and contrary natures, namely of light and heavy, hot and cold, moist and dry that one might by affinity pass into the other, and so a composition be made of bodies, which might be very different one from another in essence, qualities, virtues, and effects: for in things perfectly mixed are the light Elements, as fire and air, and also the heavy, as earth and water, which are so equally tempered together, that one recedes not from the other, but suffers itself to be easily taken and held by the other as neighbor by neighbor: Earth and air are contrary one to the other, so fire and water, yet notwithstanding fire maintains friendship with air by heat common to both, with earth by siccity: so air with water, and water with earth: by which means they are all joined by bonds of affinity or rather consanguinity, and do remain together in one composition, which, if it abound with the light Elements, elevates the heavy with it, if with the heavy, weighs down the light with it: This is declared by the two Eagles, one with wings, the other without, of which that which endeavored to fly is restrained by the other an example hereof is evident in the fight of the Falcon and Heron, for the Falcon soaring higher in the air by his Speedy flying, takes and tears the Heron with his Talons, by whose weight both fall to the ground: The contrary appeared in the artificial dove or Automa of Archytas, where heavy things were lifted up by light, that is, the wooden body of it carried into the air by the Spirit included within: In the Philosophical subject the light things do first predominate the heavy, as to plenty, but they are overcome by virtue of the heavy things, and in processe of time the Eagles wings are cut off, and one very great bird (namely an Ostrich) is made of two, which can consume iron, and which being impeded by weight runs more upon the earth, than flys in the air, though it has goodly wings: Concerning this or the like Hermes (as the Author of Aurora chapt. 5. affirms) writes thus: I have considered a bird worthy to be had in estimation by the wise, which flys when it is in Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn, and you will never fail of it in pure mines, and rocky mountains: Concerning the same Senior in Tabula, where two are seen, one volatile the other without wings, whereof one holds the others tail by its beak, that they cannot easily be seperated: For this is the device and machination of universal nature, always to raise heavy things by light, and likewise to depress light things by heavy, as the Author of the perfect Magistery declares, who constitutes seven mineral spirits, as it were erratic Stars, and 28 so many metallic bodies, as fixed Stars, and enjoins these to be wedded to those: from thence also Aristotle the Chymist, the Spirit, says he, having dissolved the body and Soul, so as to exist in their form, does not remain a fixed thing, unless you operate upon it: now operation is to join it with the body, from which you prepared it at first: because the Spirit is thereby prevented from flight being mixed with the supersistences of the body: the light Elements, namely air and fire, as a learned man declares, do in Camphor oversway the heavy; and therefore it is said wholly to exhale and evaporate into air. In Argent vive, the flowers of Sulphur, Antimony, the Salt of Harts blood, Sal Armoniacke, and such others, the earth flys with the air into the Alembic, and is not seperated from it. In Gold, glass, Diamond, the Stone Smyris, Granites, and the like, the Elements do notwithstanding fire remain a long time joined without detriment, and the earth retains those things which are left in itself. In other combustibles division and separation of one thing from another is effected, so that the ashes are left in the bottom, the water, air, and fire fly upwards: we must not therefore have respect to the unequal composition of these last, being not so strongly mixed, nor to the commixtion of the first, though more durable, yet volatile, but to the solidity, constancy, and fixity of the middle: for so the bird without wings will detain that which has, and the fixed substance will fix the volatile, which must necessarily be done . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem08.html","doctitle":"Emblem 8","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA IVVIII. in 8 supra.

Many and several sorts of birds there are, which as they are indefinite in number, so are they unknown to us by names: Story tells us of a very great bird appearing at a certain time of the year in a small Isle of the Sea called Ruc, because it can lift up an Elephant with it into the air. India and America do yield Parrots of various color, Crows, and the like: but it is not the Philosophical intention to inquire after the eggs of these birds: The Egyptians do yearly infest, and as it were with a public war denounced prosecute the Eggs of Crocodiles with weapons of iron; the Philosophers do burn their egg with fire, not to mortify and destroy it, but that it may receive life and growth; for when a chicken is from thence produced animated and living, it cannot be said to be the corruption but generation of it: it ceases indeed to be an egg by the privation of the oval form, and begins to be an animal with two feet and volatile by the introduction of a more noble form: In an egg are the seeds of both male and female joined together under one cover or shell: The yolk constitutes the chicken, and the radical parts and bowels thereof, the seed of the male being the former, and internal efficient: The white yields matter, or thread and increment to the rudiment as it were to the warp of the chicken: External heat is the first mover, which does by a certain circulation of the Elements, together with instinct and guidance of nature introduce a new form by changing one thing into another: for water turnes into air, air into fire, and fire into earth, upon the conjunction of which, a specific form being transmitted by the Stars, an individual is made of a certain kind of bird, namely of that, whose egg it was, and seed infused in it. Is it indeed said to be smitten with a fiery sword, whilst Vulcan officiating the duty of a midwife gives passage or egress to the chicken by his axe, as to Pallas out of the brain of Jupiter: This is that which Basill Valentine affirms, that Mercury was imprisoned by Vulcan at the command of Mars, and not released, before he was wholly putrified and dead: but this death is to him the beginning of a new life, as the corruption or death of an egg brings new generation and life to the chicken, so an Embryo being freed from that human vegetable life (which alone he enjoyed in his mothers womb, another more perfect is obtained by coming into the light of this world, as by nativity: yea also we being deprived of this present life, which we lead, another most perfect and eternal is at hand: Thus Lully does in many places call this fiery sword a Sharp Spear; because fire does as a Sharp Spear or sword perforate bodies, and make them porous and pervious, that water can penetrate to dissolve and reduce them from hardness to softness and tractability. In the Stomach of a Cormorant, which is of all birds most voracious, are found long and round worms alive, which are to it as the instrument of heat, they forthwith invading, and as most sharp needles perforating, (as we have sometimes observed) and so in a very short time consuming the Eels and other fish taken by it, with a wonderful operation of nature: as therefore heat pricks, so a thing pricking sometimes supplies the 31 place of heat: upon which consideration that, wherewith the Philosophers egg ought to be pieced and smitten, may not undeservedly be called a fiery sword: but the Philosophers had rather have it understood of a temperate heat, whereby the egg is kept warm, as Morforleus in Turba declares, saying, wise men ought to burn away moisture first with a slow fire, as is Showed to us by an example in the generation of a chicken, and where the fire is augmented, the vessel must be stopped on all sides, that the body of the brass, and the fugitive Spirit thereof may not exhale. But what birds was the egg? Moscus in the same place; now I Say, says he, that no instruments are made, except of our white, starry, splendid powder, and of the white stone, of which powder are made fit instruments for the egg; yet they have not named the egg, nor what birds the egg was . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem09.html","doctitle":"Emblem 9","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA IX. in 5 supra.

All things whatsoever do grow in length, breadth, and depth, that is, are propagated, nourished, and augmented to maturity, the same things do also decrease, that is, are diminished in faculties, die, and are wholly demolished, as is manifestly evident in all vegetables and animals: wherefore man also having arrived at full growth admits of decrement, that is, old age, whereby his strength is gradually diminished even till the approach of death: now the cause of old age is the same as is of a lamp decaying, and shining obscurely the oil being almost consumed: For as there are three things in a lamp, the match, fatness, and flame, so in man the vital parts, bowels, and ligaments are the match, fatness the radical moisture, flame the natural heat; all the difference is that the flame of a lamp shines, the natural heat not at all, it not being fire, but only heat, and that fatness is oily, the radical moisture viscous, as being of a seminal principle: As also a lamp is extinguished through want of oil, so man by old age, without any other disease, falls into a marasme, and aged consumption, and lastly death: They relate of the Eagle, that in old age being hindered by a crooked beak it would be famished to death, if it were not restord by nature as it were to youth by casting the beak: So Harts seem to grow young again by not indeed really, because the consumed radical moisture is not restored to them, but as to appearance: that which can make a man grow young again is nothing, but death itself, and the beginning of eternal life ensuing: as to external form, and the restoration of strength in some measure, together with the taking away of wrinkles and gray hairs, some there are that say a remedy may be found, which Lully affirms of the Quintessence, Arnold of prepared gold: But here the Philosophers say, that an old man, to become young, must be shut up with a certain tree in a house of dew, and then he will eat of the fruit of the tree, and so recover youth: It is scarce believed by the vulgar that such trees are now in the nature of things: Of Myrobalans, the fruit of a tree, Physicians write wonders, as if they could perform such a thing, take away gray hairs, purify the blood, and prolong life: but these things are doubted by many men, unless they are said to effect it by accident, as also other things, which purge the mass of blood from feces mixed with it, and dye gray hair with blackness, with which Myrobalans are reported to color the hair and ball of the eyes. Marsilius Ficinus in his booke of preserving the life of students, writes, that in order to attain to long life it is commodious for a man daily to suck the milk of some certain beautiful and young woman, instead of which others do commend the eating of vipers flesh: but indeed these means are themselves 34 more rigid than old age, and scarce to be used by one of a thousand, though they Should not be without certain effect: It is written by Paracelsus in his book of long life, that a sick man may attract to himself the health of another by imagination alone, as also an old man youth, but this Author seems in this to use his imagination only, not experience: It is thing certain of the Psylli who have two balls of the eye, and of witches, that they bewitch children and cattle by aspect alone, from whence that of Virgil: Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinet agnos: but these things are done without contact, whereby the tree restores the old man to youth: for this tree has sweet fruit, ripe and red, which do easily turn into pure blood, being of easy digestion and excellent nutriment, so as to leave nothing superfluous or feculent in the body: but the old man abounds with white phlegm, and is of a white color and hairy, which humor, color, and hair are changed by eating these fruits, and become red, as those are of young men. For this reason say the Philosophers, the Stone is first old, that is white, then young, that is, red, because this is the color of youth, as that of old age: It is added, that the old man ought to be Shut up with the tree, not in the open air, but in a house, not dry, but moist with dew. It is accounted a miracle for trees to Spring or vegetate in a close place, but if it be moist, there is no doubt of their long duration: for the nutriment of a tree is moisture, and airy earth, that is, fat, which can ascend into the trunk and boughs, and there produce leaves, flowers: and fruit, in which natural work all the Elements do concur, fire giving the first motion, as the efficient, air tenuity and penetrability, water lubricity, earth coagulation: for air returns into water, and water into earth, if any of their superfluity ascend: By fire I mean the natural heat, which being propagated with the seed does by the power of the Stars as it were a Smith fabricate and form fruit like to those things from whence the seed arises: But a dewy evaporation is not only good and expedient to moisten the tree, that it may more easily yield fruit, but also the old man, that by those fruits he may become young again, that is to say, the dewy evaporation mollifying, filling up, and restoring his wrinkled and dry Skin with temperate heat and moisture: for Physicians do advisedly and with great utility enjoin and prescribe warm baths in the marasme and aged consumption: but if the thing be well considered that tree is the daughter of the old man, which as Daphne is transmuted into a vegetable of the like sort, and therefore the old man does not without reason expect youth from it, which caused it to be effected . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem10.html","doctitle":"Emblem 10","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA X. in 2. infra.

If this saying be taken literally, it only increases the quality of fire and Mercury, and introduces no new quality in the subject: for every like being added to its like makes a similar augmentation: and therefore Physicians affirm that contrary diseases are cured and taken away by contrary medicines, so we see that fire is extinguished by water, but sustained by adding fire: The Poet is of the same opinion saying: Venus rages in wine, fire in fire: but it may be answered, that fire and fire, Mercury and Mercury are very different one from another: for there are many kinds of fires with the Philosophers, many also of Mercury: Moreover the same heat and cold being distant only in place or situation, differs from another of its own kind, so as to attract to it that which is like to itself, that heat fixed in any part is attracted and drawn forth by the same heat, and that the joints being stupefied with the cold of winter, and almost dead with cold water, are restored if they be put into it, not by external heat immediately administered: as indeed a greater light obscures the less, so also greater heat the less, and greater cold the less: nevertheless it is requisite for the external heat and cold to be less, than that which was before fixed or imprinted on the parts or joints, otherwise the same impression would be made, as before, and the like would be much more increased, than drawn out, by the like: for the drawing out of cold by cold water, and of fiery heat by heat is agreeable to nature, because every sudden mutation into a contrary is dangerous to it, and less acceptable, but that which is by little and little, and as it were by degrees is tolerable: so we say, there is one internal fire, and is already infixed and essential in the Philosophical subject, another external, which may also be understood of Mercury: that is an internal fire equivocally because of its fiery qualities, virtues, and operations, external univocally: External fire therefore must be given to the internal, and the like Mercury to Mercury, that the intention of the art may be completed: To mollify or mature any hard or crude thing by coction, we use fire and water: for water dissolves hardness, and penetrates into the compact parts, heat adding strength and motion to it; as appears by example in the coction of Peas, which are of themselves sound and hard, but do swell, are broken, and reduced to a pulp by water, the heat of fire rarefying the water by ebullition, and making it of a more thin or almost airy substance: So the heat of fire resolves the crude parts of fruit or flesh into water, and causes them to evaporate with it into air: after the same manner fire and Mercury here are fire and water, and the same, fire and Mercury are the mature and crude parts, of which the crude are to be matured by coction, or the mature purged from superfluities by the ministery of fire and water: Now that these are two fires, and two Mercuries principally and solely necessary to the art, we will here briefly demonstrate: Empedocles determined two principles of all things, love, and variance, or friendship and dis 37cord: that by variance corruptions were made, generations by love: such variance is manifestly beheld between fire and water, fire causing water to evaporate, if it can, water on the contrary extinguishing fire, if admitted to it: but for all that it is conspicuous that generations may be made of the same with some certain friendship; for by heat a new generation of air is made of water, and by the same the induration of water into a stone, and so out of these two Elements as it were the first are made also the other two, and by consequence the production of all things: Water was the matter of heaven, and of all corporal things: Fire, as the form, moves and informs this matter; so this water or Mercury yields the matter, and fire or Sulphur, the form: which two, that they may come to operation, and move themselves mutually by solution, coagulation, alteration, tinction, and perfection, have need of external helps, as instruments, without NB which no effect could follow: For as a Smith effects nothing without hammer and fire, so neither the Philosopher without his instruments, which are water and fire: And this water is called by some the water of clouds, as this fire occasioned fire: It is without doubt called the water of clouds, because it is distilled, as the dew of May, of most thin parts: for as the dew of the said month being included in an eggshell is affirmed to raise the egg, or its continent, high by the heat of the Sun, so also this water of the clouds, or dew makes the Philosophers egg ascend, that is, sublimes, exalts, and perfects it: The same water is also most Sharp vinegar, which has made a body a mere Spirit: for as vinegar is of different qualities, namely to penetrate to the bottom, and astringe, so this water dissolves and coagulates, but is not coagulated, because it is not of a proper subject: Now this water is had from the fountain of Parnassus, which contrary to the nature of other fountains is at the top ofthe. . a mountain, made by the hoof of the flying horse Pegasus. There must also be actual fire, which notwithstanding must be governed and qualified by its degrees, as by bridles. For as the Sun proceeding from Aries into Leo gradually increases heat to things growing, by approaching always nearer, so is it here necessary to be done: for the Philosophers infant must be nourished by fire, as milk, the more he grows, the more fruitful . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem11.html","doctitle":"Emblem 11","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XI. in 6. supra.

So great is the diversity of Authors in writing, that the explorators of truth do almost despair of finding the end of art: for Allegorical speeches being of themselves difficult to be understood, and the causes of many errors, especially then, if the same words be applied to different things, and different words to the same things: out of which if a man would extricate himself, he must either be of a divine genius, to perceive the truth involved in so great darkness, or of endless pains and charge in proving what is true, what not: But the Philosophers say one is not sufficient without the other, an acute genius without hand=labor, or this without that, as neither the theory without the practice, and contrarywise: for no man is of so discreet an understanding as to avoid a hundred thousand circumvagations, errors, falsities as to the word, digressions, and ambiguities, and persist in the true path of nature: wherefore say the Philosophers, he that has not as yet erred, has not yet begun, and that errors are the informers of those things which ought to be done or not. So the same do inculcate, that a man may spend his whole life, though he Should live a thousand years, in distilling and redistilling, before he can attain to truth by experimentation alone: That little benefit can be had without study and reading of authors, the Corrector of fools signifies, saying: Study removes ignorance, and reduces a mans genius to true understanding, and the knowledge of every thing: It is therefore principally necessary to acquire the knowledge of this delectable work by study, and to sharpen the wit by Philosophical sayings, the knowledge of truth being centered in them: If therefore operators despise not study, they will sweetly relish the fruit from thence proceeding: but they that abhor study, and yet are willing to operate, let them see whether that art be the imitation of nature herself, which the art of her desires to amend: because it is impossible for it to prepare the Philosophers secrets to a perfect end: Of these men say the Sophi, that they run to practice as an ass to hay, not knowing what to lay his nose to, only so far as the outward senses do without understanding lead him to food by sight and taste: these are his words. But lest a man should macerate himself with overmuch study, which is an inexhaustible sea and of immense profundity and endeavor (though in vain) to bring every letter, agreeing also with many other things, into act, in the mean time consuming or diminishing his strength, time, reputation, wealth and riches, the Philosophers do use this Emblematical speech, that Latona must be whitened, and those books torn, lest their hearts be broken, for there are many books so obscurely written, as to be understood by their own Authors only: not a few left out!! of envy to seduce others, or rather to retard them, that they may not attain to their end without difficulty, or to obscure those things written before by themselves: But what is the meaning of whitening Latona? this is the work this the labor to inquire: Clangor buccinæ affirms Latona to be an 40 imperfect body compounded of Sol and Luna. The most ancient Poets and writers affirm Latona to be the mother of Sol and Luna, or Apollo and Diana, others the Nurse; and that Diana was first born (for Luna and whiteness first appears) and did then perform the office of a midwife the same day in bringing forth her brother Apollo. Latona was indeed one ! of the twelve divine Hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, by whom these and other Allegories were propagated amongst other nations, very few of the Egyptians Priests, and those only understanding the true meaning and sense of them, all the rest referring them to other subjects, which were not in the nature of things, namely various Gods, Goddesses, and the like: Hereupon Latona had there the most sumptuous temple next to Vulcan, covered and adorned with gold, as She that was the Mother of the Philosophical Apollo and Diana: but this Latona is brown and blackish, and has many moles and blemishes in her face, which must be taken away by art, namely by dealbation: Some do make dealbations of Ceruse, Mercury Sublimate, Talc, reduced into oil, and the like, with which they incrust, cover, and so whiten the outside of the Skin; but these whitening incrustations fall off with every wind or liquor, because they do not penetrate to the more inward parts: But the Philosophers care not for such colorations, which are used more to deceive the eyes, than to tinge the internal substance of the body: For they would have the face of Latona whitened thoroughly, and the Skin itself altered, that is, truly, and not superficially: a Question might be asked how it can be? I answer, Latona must be first sought out and known, which though She be taken out of a vile place, must notwithstanding be sublimed to a more worthy, but if She be taken out of a more worthy place, She must be thrown into a place more vile, namely into dung: for there will She become truely white, and be made white lead, which being had, there is no need to doubt of success, or red lead, which is the beginning and end of the work . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem12.html","doctitle":"Emblem 12","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XII. in 2. supra.

Know would you why the Poets so recount The fame of Helicon, the Muses mount? That monumental stone is placed thereon, Which Saturn gorged instead of Jove his Son. Be wise, the sense agrees not with the Sound, For Saturn's Stone in Chymistry is found.","discourse-en":"Discourse 12. The Allegory of Saturn we find to be taken diverse ways: for the Astronomers repute him the highest of the Planets in order; the young students of Chymistry the meanest of metals, namely lead: The heathen Poets: conceived him to be the father of Jupiter, Son of Cœlum; the Mythologists time. But though all these may seem to have thought aright in their sense, yet they will not declare those things which are elsewhere spoken of Saturn, why he devoured and vomited up his sons, and a stone instead of Jupiter, why he is the discoverer of truth, why appearing with a scythe, a serpent, blackness, morosity, and distorted feet? Herein the last think themselves to interpret best, saying, that time reveals and manifests truth, slides away as a Serpent, cuts all things down with death as by a scythe, devours its children, that is, all those things which it has generated, digests hard stones, or cannot consume them, and therefore does as it were vomit them up again: These things do indeed agree in part, but are not consonant to the truth of the thing, and all circumstances. But the exercises Philosophers do say, that Saturn is first in their work, which if he be really present, they cannot err, truth is discovered in darkness; but there is nothing besides blackness: wherefore they say in Turba Philosophorum, whatsoever color comes after blackness is laudable: and when you see your matter black, rejoice, because it is the beginning of the work: And, when it is first black, we say it is the key of the work, because it is not effected without blackness, as the Rosary has it, with Arnold, and the Speculum: when you are operating, endeavor to obtain first a black color, and then will you be certain that you putrefy, and proceed the right way. And a little after: that blackness is called earth, which is made by light decoction so often repeated, till blackness be most eminent: For this reason say the same, that Saturn possesses the earth, Mercury water, Jupiter air, Sol fire. Saturn therefore is blackness, the discoverer of truth, who follows a stone instead of Jupiter. For blackness, that is, a dark cloud covers the stone as first, that it cannot be seen: Therefore says Morienes every body without a soul is dark and obscure: And Hermes: Take his head dissolve it with the Sharpest vinegar, or the urine of children, till it be made dark: This being performed he lives in putrefaction, and the dark clouds which were upon him, and in his body, before he died, are returned. This stone is again disgorged by Saturn, when it becomes white, and then is it set upon the top of Helicon for a monument to men, as Hesiod writes: for whiteness is really comprehended under blackness, which is drawn out of its bowels, that is, out of the stomach of Saturn. therefore says Democritus; putrify Tin with a peculiar ablution, draw its blackness and obscurity from it, and the whiteness of it will appear. And in Turba it is said: Join the dry with the moist, that is, the black earth with its water, and coct, till it be whitened. This Arnold in Novum lumen chapt. 4. excellently declares, saying; That moisture therefore which caused blackness in decoction, Shows itself to be dried, when the white color begins to appear. And a little after: And my Master said to me, that that brunity ascended, because the whiteness 43 was drawn out of the belly of its blackness, as is said in Turba: For when you see it black know that the whiteness of it is hidden in the bowels of the blackness first appearing. As the Same blackness is called Saturn, so also Lead: Thereupon says Agadimon in Turba: Coct your brass, till the blackness come forth, which they call money, and mix the matters of your art, and you will find blackness presently, which is the Philosophers lead, of which they have treated much in their books: Hitherto relates the saying of Emiganus, that the Splendor of Saturn ascending into the air appears no otherwise than darkened. And of Plato in the Rosary; The first way of governing Saturn is to putrefy and put it upon Sol: by which it is evident that the sense of the Philosophers, speaking of Saturn, is far different from the common acceptation. This Saturn generates Jupiter, that is, an obscure whiteness, Jupiter of Latona Diana, that is perfect whiteness, and Apollo, that is, redness; and this is the successive mutation of all perfect colors: This Stone cast out by Saturn is reported to be placed at the top of the mountain as a monument to men, which is a thing most true . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem13.html","doctitle":"Emblem 13","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XIII. in 4. seu 11. supra.

That Naaman the Syrian betook himself to Judea at the persuasion of the Prophet, and washed himself seven times in the river Jordan, is to be ascribed to his confidence in the Prophets words, but that he was freed from the Leprosy by that washing, is a miracle of divine omnipotence: For the Leprosy, which being seated in the blood, and radical parts of mans body, is as it were an universal Canker, cannot be cured or taken away by any external washings, much less of cold water, such as was of Jordan. After the same manner that the Philosophers brass diseased with an Hydropsy, Should be freed from it by the washings of water, yea that being imperfect it Should be reduced to perfection, and being sick to health, so as to be able to communicate the same to other sick bodies, is next to a miracle: For such an example is not elsewhere extant in nature, nor is it the ordinary way of nature to produce the Philosophers most absolute tincture, unless it be governed by art, and fit subjects administered to it with the external efficient. So the restitution of luxations or dislocations is not peculiar to nature, but art: Nevertheless the Os Sacrum opens itself miraculously in the birth of a child, that the infant may thereby have egress, as by a door, and herein the most great and merciful God operates by nature above nature: So that the Stone should be perfected, may seem to be a thing supernatural, though really it is natural: Wherefore says a Philosopher in the Rosary, You must know that our stone is airy and volatile, externally cold and moist, internally hot and dry: and that coldness and moisture which is external, is a watery fume, corrupting, blacking, and destroying itself and all things, and flies from fire: and that heat and siccity which is internal, is gold hot and dry, and is a most pure oil, penetrating bodies, and is not fugitive, because the heat and siccity of Alchemy tinges, and nothing else: Cause therefore the external coldness and watery moisture, to be like to the internal heat and siccity, so that they may agree and be united together, and all at once bemade one penetrating, tinging, and fixing body: but these moistures must be destroyed by fire, and degrees of fire with soft temperament, and a congruous and moderate digestion: These there: But if true, how can it be freed from water by water? but it may be answered, that some certain waters are hot and dry in quality, such as are many baths, in which it must be Philosophically washed: For this is that which they say, wash with fire, and burn with water; for that fire, which washes, and that water, which burns, differ one from the other in name only, but agree in effect and operation: That brass therefore must be washed, that is, dried from its superfluous moistures by this water, or this fire: We have known experiments of Hydropical bodies cured by six months abstinence from any drink, by being buried in hot sand, or Cows dung, by being put in a hot furNBnace, and sweating, and innumerable other helps, yea also by drying baths, such as are at Carolina and Wisbadenses not far from Mentz: By the same ways must this Patient be cured, sometimes by waters, 46 sometimes by the hot air of furnaces, sometimes by dung, sometimes Sand, and by abstaining from drink: for these are most effectual remedies in both cases, here and there to be used: but in all these things heat is the operator, which draws forth and consumes the superfluous water by the Emunctories or also pores of the body: For external heat quickens the internal, that is, the vital Spirits, to expel that moisture which is noxious to it, as an unprofitable excrement, by which the natural heat was before suppressed as by an enemy: In this cure there is need of great diligence and precaution, lest whilst one bowel is helped, another be hurt: In a Quartan (the Platonic probation of a Physician) we find, that thick and viscous humors, like the gum or glue of trees, being gathered together from all the veins and mass of blood, do descend through the hollow or great vein even to the bottom of the back, where obstructing the emulgent veins, which draw the serous humor out of the blood, or the passages of them, they are less able to operate, and more serous liquor remains in the body, and so in a short time, if care be not taken, a Dropsy may happen, the other bowels being also untainted at first: Diuretics do here little or no good, purgatives yet less, unless diminution and eduction be made in some certain series of time: Sudorifics are also manifestly hurtful, because they draw out the more subtle parts, leaving the thicker, and being continued debilitate the body: for the custom of nature is to find that way to evacuate serosities through the pores when she is obstructed about the bladder: This therefore is Scylla, the other Charybdis, both which he that has a mind to preserve himself ought to avoid: But that Dropsy which proceeds from an impaired Liver or Spleen, if it be confirmed, is of most difficult cure: Now in the Philosophical brass the cure is not impossible, the distemper being rather by accident, and secondary, than essential or primary, provided it be cautiously begun, as we have said concerning the plenty of serum in a Quartan, to wit, that it may not by overmuch exsiccation fall into a consumption, or by humectation into a Dropsy difficult to be cured . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem14.html","doctitle":"Emblem 14","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XIV. in 8. infrà.

It is a saying of the Ancients, that a Serpent, which has devoured a Serpent, becomes a Dragon: for it is cruel to its kind, as a thief and Murderer to his: It is evident that such are in Africa, of so great bigness and plenty, that they destroyed a great part of Alexander's army: Amongst the Asachæi a people of Ethiopia are very great produced, which being wrapped together after the manner of hurdles do with their heads lifted up make way to better pasture. They report that the Kings of India maintained two Dragons, one of eighty, and the other of ninety cubits in bigness: by the observation of later writers and nowadays it is known, that near Angola are found such as are equal to the great masts of ships: So they report that in some certain mountains of India and Africa there is great store of gold, but kept by dragons, lest any one come thither and take it away: For dragons do resort to fountains or rivers, which fall from the mountains, and so are said to watch the gold by accident: for this reason do the Philosophers ascribe so many dragons or serpents to their treasures, as to the golden Fleece, the garden of the Hesperides, and to other persons or Chymical subjects, to Cadmus, Saturne, Aesculapius, Mercury, whose wand is begirt with two Serpents, male and female: but do they mean nothing else by Dragons, but Chymical subjects? Hereupon say they, the Dragons yield mountains, and the earth fountains to Rebis, and denoting the extreme hunger of the dragon in devouring his tail: which though others may interpret of the year returning into itself, and resembling a circle, yet it was accommodated by the Philosophers to their things, who by this dragon would have a Serpent understood, which devours another of its own kind, and this is properly called Sulphur, as they all attest in innumerable places: Lully in his little book chapt. 31. This is, says he, Sulphur, my Son! and this the Serpent and dragon devouring his tail, the roaring lion, and sharp sword, cutting, mortifying, and tearing all things. And the Rosary: The Dragon dies not, unless he be killed with his brother and Sister. And a little after: The Dragon is Argent vive extracted from bodies, having in it a body, Soul, and spirit: This is in the same place called by another name Fetid water, which is produced after the separation of the Elements: Now the Dragon is said to devour his tail, in consuming the voluble, venomous, and moist part, that after without a tail he may seem more corpulent and of less Speed, for the motion and volubility of him consisted chiefly in his tail: Other animals depend upon feet, but dragons, Serpents, and worms of that kind do use constriction and explication of body instead of feet, and as it were water poured out do divide into certain courses, inclining themselves sometimes this way sometimes that, as you may see in almost all rivers, how they turn their courses like Serpents, and run obliquely in circuits: they did not therefore without reason call Argent vive a Serpent, and and add serpents to Mercury, it also drawing as it were a tail, and running sometimes this sometimes that way with a voluble poise: For as a Serpent creeps so also Mercury, who has therefore wings upon his feet and head. 49 In Africa they say are flying Serpents, which would waste and depopulate all things, if they were not destroyed by the bird calld Ibis: For which cause Ibis is erected amongst the sacred Egyptian images, both for the manifest utility, which it performs to the whole country, and for an occult reason, which very few men have understood. This dragon biting of his tail, and casting his old skin is said to acquire a new one together with youth, as nature has granted longer life not only to Crows, Ravens, Eagles, and Harts, but also to the Serpentine kind: The Ant growing old acquires wings, so also many worms: Man growing old is put into the earth, but being revived from the earth will be consecrated to eternal life. Of every Serpent burned is made a powder, which is taken safely against all poisons with great effect: Such an Alexipharmacum ought also to be made of this dragon (who has already devoured his tail, which is usually cut off in Vipers) a most effectual remedy against the adversities of fortune and body . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem15.html","doctitle":"Emblem 15","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XV. in 3. infrà.

As this orb is by the connection of earth and water conglobated into one round body, so also the Potters work seems to be compounded of the same Elements particularly, namely of siccity and moisture, that one may regulate the other: for if the earth should be without water, neither the Ocean, sea, lakes, rivers, or fountains would be near the earth, it could bear nothing of itself, but remain barren: So if water should not be received into the cavities of the earth, but stand about, it would easily cover the whole earth, and so the same remain inhabitable: but one entering amicably into the other, and water moderating the siccity of the earth, the earth the moisture of that, by their mutual commixtion, hereby is the fertility and utility of both Elements conspicuous: In like manner the Potter mixes clay with water, to make thereof a tractable mass, which he Shapes by his wheel, and sets in the warme air, that it may be gradually dried; then adds violence of fire, that his vessels may be well hardened, and condensed into a durable stone, which can resist both water and fire: So also must we proceed in the natural work as the Philosophers attest, and therefore do affirm that example ought to be taken from the Potters. For as to siccity and moisture, that is, earth and water, we doubt not that there is much affinity in both, but much difference in the way of coction, and in the matter and form of compounding the Elements: For Potters vessels have an artificial form, the Philosophical tincture a form altogether natural, and so much more noble than they, by how much the more excellent the matter of this is than theirs: either is indeed a work of earth, but in the Philsophical there is nothing said to be, which has not ascended and attained to the heaven of air, in that a thick and feculent earth is predominant: The effect of both is a stone, there a common, here a Philosophical: by which name a certain person being seduced put a great number of artificial stones or tiles into one chest, and the whiter sort of flints into another, using Diabolical conjurations from above, by which the last were at a certain time to be converted into silver, the first into pure gold: but they being supposed to be the Philosophers Stones, and therefore a great sum of money accruing to purchase several things, when the new gold and Silver might be expected, at a certain time, in which it not appearing, nor the stones converted into gold, as was desired, death put an end to the folly and Shame: For gold or Silver ought not to be expected from that thing, in which it is not naturally, diabolical Magic having no place in these divine works, but is as far different from them, as the author of it from a devout and pious man, hell from heaven: So though it may be esteemed the true Philosophical stone, yet let not any man persuade himself, that impossible things can performed by it, us Isaac admonishes: no man being bound either by the laws of nature, or polity to things im 52possible: as for the transmutation of gems by it, and performing the malleability of glass any man thereby perceive, whether these things are possible, and congruous to this nature, or no: Geber affirms that the Philosophers speak many things allegorically, as also of himself, that where he Spoke clearly and plainly, he said nothing, but where figuratively, there he absconded the truth, as wheat under chaff: Those things which a man sows, the same also will he reap, which takes place in vegetables and animals, though different Species may sometimes proceed from the things sowed: whether these ought to be applied to metals, which are not propagated by seed, as those, must be considered: In these the parts only are homogeneous, Sulphur, and Argent vive, in those they are heterogeneous or organic: In these are no receptacles of seed, but in those: In these there is not found any nutrition, augmentation, or extension in all dimensions, in those very much: yea these are elemented weights admitting mixtion alone, those also besides mixtion have either a vegetive or sensitive soul: Nevertheless it is without doubt true that there is something in places under the earth, which is not gold now, but will after a thousand years be gold by nature: Who will deny this to be the analogical seed of gold? both gold and the aurific nature being of one original and radix, though this of the more noble form, and therefore the seed of gold being known, this also will be manifested: The Philosophers affirm siccity and moisture or Sulphur and Argent vive to be that, which being most pure must be extracted out of two mountains . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem16.html","doctitle":"Emblem 16","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XVI. in 5. suprà.

It is a thing known by experience that a Lion excels other animals not so much in bigness and strength of body, as generosity: if he be seen in hunting, being ashamed to run away, he releases himself by degrees, if he be oppressed by a multitude: being removed from the view of the hunters, he makes hast away, thinking it a dishonor to be excused by absconding: he desires a wood in flight, which he uses, when anything pursues: his bones are solid and not at all empty, which are said to be so hard, that being shaked together they yield fire as out of a Steel and flint. He fears fire above all things. He seems to derive his substance from the nature of the Sun, for in force and heat he excels other animals, as the Sun does the Stars: Besides he is always beheld with fiery and open eyes, as the Sun beholds the earth with an open and fiery eye: a Lioness fighting for her whelps fixes her eyes upon the ground, that She may not be afraid of the hunters Staffs and Spears. where a Lion perceives the coition of a Leopard, he takes revenge upon the Lioness for adultery, and inflicts severe punishment; The Lioness therefore washes away the offense and scent in a river, or being conscious of the trespass does also accompany the adulterer flying for fear of the male: Which wonderful nature of this beast the Philosophers contemplating, have produced several allegories of the Lion, as it were hieroglyphical writings testifying of their secret work, observing the Lion to be a constant, firm animal, without deceit and suspicion, they assimilated the better part of their Philosophical composition to him: for as he flies not, so neither this: he with solid bones, so this fixed and not to be overcome: and as the Lioness is not always innocent and free from adultery, so is neither Luna nor Mercury without some blemish, but is joined by the ignorant sometimes to this, sometimes to that matter, whereby an adulterous conjunction of things discrepant and different in nature rather than true matrimony is established: for the products of a Leopard and Lioness have no specious and comely manes about the neck and Shoulders; with which ensign those generated by the Lion are alone adorned. The Philosophical Lioness must therefore be joined to her proper mate or male, and a genuine and generous whelp will from thence Spring, which may easily be known by his paw. But the Lioness must not be any or what you please, but winged, which may be able to fight and contest with the Lion, depending upon the Swiftness of her plumes, lest (to wit) She Should be oppressed by his extraordinary wrath, but to think upon escape, if at any time he fall into fury without cause, for he when he stops her flying 55 is incited with greater love towards her, friendship being made after discord. But you will say who ever saw a Lioness with wings, or what can the plumes of a Lioness avail? There is a deep valley near the mountain Cithaeron, in which are seen none but flying Lionesses, and at the top of the same mountain resorts a red Lion of that kind, which Hercules killed. The Lion therefore must be taken, and brought into the valley, and forthwith coupled to the winged Lioness: She also will easily suffer herself to be overcome, as like by like: afterwards they must be both advanced out of the said valley to the top of the mountain, and henceforth they will never desert one another, but always remain together in inviolable amity: The taking of Lions. I confess, is not easy, but obnoxious to many dangers, nevertheless it must be attempted: a Lion feeds not with the Lioness, but strays apart, as story relates, therefore they are to be found and hunted severally: But if the Lions whelps be obtained in their infancy, when they first begin to go, which is at two months age, and be joined, as said, being come to good growth and stature, the thing will be free from any danger. Moreover they breed in the Spring time, which must be well observed: but Lions after whelping using cross and winding ways, to prevent the discovery of their den, therefore must they be sought and their whelps taken away with very great diligence and care . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem17.html","doctitle":"Emblem 17","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XVII. in 3. suprà.

By these young Students may to truth aspire.","discourse-en":"Discourse 17. The Philosophers have in many places made mention of four sorts of fire necessary to the natural work, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley, and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (Says Scala). You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, so contrariwise the fire of nature congeals the dissolved spirit of a fixed body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into Philosophical water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus: There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the natural, unnatural, fire against nature, and elemental, which kindles wood: These fires we use, and no more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate bodies, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell. The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every thing: Occasioned fire we call unnatural, as the heat of ashes and baths to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, whereby your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your glass, which can burn bodies more effectually, than elemental fire: these are their sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue, the natural in coagulating, the unnatural in dissolving, the fire against nature in corrupting, the elemental in administering the first heat and motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Second may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by the third and first together to action, so as that one is the agent, and the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a Magnet, and joined by mutual contact, the same in these fires: for the elemental does like the Magnet emit its virtue though the second and third even to the fourth, and joins one to another by mutual operations, and causes them to stick together, till internal action be effected amongst the uppermost: The first is elemental fire indeed and name, the second is air or airy, the third watery or of a Lunar nature, the fourth earthy: It is needless to say any thing of the first, because it is known to every mans eye and touch: The three other are dragons, menstrua's, waters, Sulphurs, and Mercuries: Dragons, because being participants of venenosity, they devour serpents of their own kind, frett and alter, that is, dissolve and coagulate bodies incorporated and mixed with them: They are called Menstrua's, because the Philosophical infant is produced from them, and nourished therewith even to its nativity: Lully in his book of the Quintessence, dist. 3. has two 58 Menstruums, the vegetable, and mineral, Ripley in his Preface of the gates has three, which are really one and do agree: for the generation of the infant is made of them altogether, and a white water preceeds the birth of it, which is not of the substance but superfluity of the infant, and therefore to be separated: They are waters, because in fire they Show a watery nature, that is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the properties of waters are different and wonderful, whereof some do petrify, being coagulated into very hard stones fit for building: Very like these are the Philosophers mineral waters, which do condense, and turn into a stony consistence: They are also called Sulphurs because of the virtue of Sulphur, which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one, and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are preserved and contained by Sulphurs, as Yximidius in Turba says: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the four elements, which being extracted by art do naturally contain one another and are joined together: if you can by water govern and purify well that which is hidden in the belly of Sulphur, that hidden thing meeting with its own nature rejoices, even as water with its like. I will now tell you (Says Mosius also) what it is: the first in deed, which is fiery Argent vive, the second, the body compounded in it, and the third is the water of Sulphur, by which the first is washed, and dilacerated, and governed, till the work be accomplished: That which is said of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of so many Mercuries: For this says the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur which ascends from a mixed compound: But I will omit the inference of more testimonies, they being infinite and obvious to every man: These four fires are included as it were in Spheres and orbs, that is, every one has a particular center, from which or to which their motion tends, but nevertheless they are kept so bound together partly by nature, partly by art, that one can operate little or nothing without another, yea the action of one is the passion of another, and on the contrary . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem18.html","doctitle":"Emblem 18","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XVIII. in 7. suprà.

Natures way of operating in all individuals of the universe is to use one single process to complete and perfect one single motion, as appears in the Anatomy of mans body, in which one muscle serves only for one motion, that is, the attractive, but for the expansive another opposite to the first, so that if any part or member be to be brought into a circular form, it must be effected by various muscles placed circlewise: so the operation of fire is one and single, that is to say, to heat and fire, yea assimilate to itself, and burn all things, to which it is applied, if they be combustible: Hereupon Says Avicenne in his book of the congelation of stones: That which falls into Saltpits, becomes Salt, and that which into fire, becomes fire, but somethings sooner, some Slower, according to the power of actives, and the resistance of passives: And there is a place in Arabia, which colors all bodies in it of its own color: So every natural thing possesses the virtue infused into it by nature, by which it acts upon things mixed or applied to it, assimilating and altering their nature and form: That which is generation in vegetables and animals by the propagation of seeds, is the infusion of virtue and assimilation in single bodies or singly mixed: the Sun, the light of heaven, projects its rays upon the earth, which, being gathered together in concavous or burning glasses, do demonstrate themselves to be produced from such a cause, as to appear to be the projectible forms of the Sun: Whereby it is manifest that the rays of the Sun are nothing else, but a fiery flame extended and dispersed into an ample latitude, which being dilated and again contracted by concavous, diaphanous and circular or repercussive instruments, does in concavous and steel mirrors Shine as a flame, and burn things obvious to it: after the same manner, a certain virtue is as a vapor dispersed in a certain elemented body, which, if it be gathered together, and attracted into one, turns into water, and that water into earth: For this reason says Avicenne in the book before alleged, Earth is made of water, when the qualities of earth overcome it, and so on the contrary: But there is a certain thing, which some ingenious men do use when they have a mind to coagulate a dry substance, which is compounded of two waters, and is called Lac virginis, which is the most certain effect of it: thus Says he: Some there are that assure themselves able to increase or multiply virtues in the Loadstone, as the like we have seen set in Silver, which being scarce one pound weight attracted and held up an iron anchor of 28 pounds, which would have been impossible, if the virtue had not been increased and made stronger in it, which without doubt was done by revocation of the dispersed virtues as it were into one point or pole, or by the attraction of the same out of a great body into a less: Others are found, who say that a plumbifying Stone may be made by the Sulphurous breath of Saturn, infused and retained, till it be thereby converted into common Mercury, which continually converts common Mercury into lead. Some boast that they can by Antimony, or the stellated Regulus thereof make Copper from the fume of Copper, in that time wherein a man may eat an egg, yea that they have made all metals: but I will not detract from their reputation, though to me it seems not 6i likely to be true: I know not whether they are more confident or successful, who endeavor to deduce gold from gold, according to the saying of the golden Poet: He that desires barley sows only barley, in gold is the seed of gold: Every natural thing has indeed a certain virtue of multiplying itself, but these things are brought into action in Vegetables and animals only, not at all in Metals, Minerals, things dug out of the earth, or Meteors: Some plants sprung from a small grain of seed do oftentimes yield a thousand or more grains of seed, and so multiply and propagate themselves, and that yearly; Animals also have their Products of greater or less number, according to the nature of every one: But gold, Silver, lead, tin, iron, copper, or Argent vive are never found to have multiplied themselves or their species after that manner, though one may be very often found commuted and nobilitated into another: Nevertheless the Philosophers affirm that the principle of ignifying is in fire, so of aurifying in gold: but where is the tincture, by which gold must be made? This must be sought in its owne principles and generations, not in things of another nature: For if fire produces fire, a Pear a Pear, a horse a horse, then lead must generate lead and not Silver, gold gold and not the tincture: Moreover the Philosophers have a peculiar gold, which they do not only not deny that it ought (but also affirm it necessarily requisite) to be added to the aurific Stone as a ferment as the end of the work.

The Poets do feign Geryon King of Spain to have been tricorporeal, who had oxen of a purple color, which a dog with two heads, and a Dragon with seven were charged with as warders: and the same Geryon is reported to be the Son of Chrysaor sprung from the blood of Medusa, and that Dragon the Son of Typhon, and Echidna: which things agreeing with no history, or truth of the matter, as it sounds, and making a noise in all Chymical Allegories, they are not without added hereto by us: But by the three bodies of Geryon we mean three faces beheld in one father, according to the sense of Hermes, or as others would have it, four, having regard to so many Elements: For of a Quadrangle ought a triangle to be made, as that made of a circle, so this to return into a circle: And the consanguinity and natural conjunction of the bodies of Geryon, or the Elements is so great, that one being overcome or killed, the rest also die of themselves and putrefy, without the administration of any manual force: As to things with two bodies it is known, that one being dead, the other also wastes and consumes: as in Italy we have seen a boy four years of age with two bodies, who absconded the head of his brother cleaving to him, within his own body, the other parts hung down to the navel, where they were bound or joined together: But if he, that hung down, and being much less, was carried by the other, Should be touched about the hands or feet too hard, the bigger did hereby feel pain, yea also hunger, if the less wanted food: And this is the combination and sympathy of nature, whereby the members and parts of one body, or joined with another are mutually moved and affected together; whereof if one sound and unhurt, yet the other do not thereby necessarily continue sound and unhurt, but if grievously hurt, the rest do also sympathize, and perish by the same malady: So if a neighbor gains much, no profit thereby accrues to his neighbor, but if he Suffers loss by fire, his neighbor receives much damage: for your affairs are in danger when your neighbors house has taken fire: It is not therefore a thing contradictory to truth, for the other three to die, by the destruction of one of these four brethren, seeing that it may happen diverse ways, either by finding the same ends as beginnings of life being born at one birth both by father and mother, as we have read has happened to some, perhaps by the inclination of the stars, or by being joined together not only in souls, but also ligaments of the body, or by consternation of mind, by strong imagination in time of pestilence, or by the vow of a league: A certain heathenish people lived by the name of Pythagoreans in the Indies under the government of the great Mogul (who now reigns there the nineth of the Successors of Tamberlan) amongst whom this ancient custom is hitherto observed, that if the husband die, his wife is burned with fire, or as now, lives perpetually in the highest infamy, deserted by all, and esteemed as a dead woman, which was therefore done, that the wives might not kill themselves by poison for their husbands, unless also 64 they were willing to die: So in the Philosophical work, one of the brethren being dead, the other do also perish by fire, not compulsively, but voluntarily, that they may not survive in sorrow and infamy: or if one be assaulted with a club, sword, or stone, he will commence civil war with his brethren, as appears in the Giants sprung from the teeth of a dragon opposing Jason, and elswhere also Cadmus, and so they will all fall by mutual destruction: For touch or hurt him that carries air, and he will insurge against those two together which are nearest to him, namely him that carries water, and him that carries fire, and these will on both sides oppose themselves against him that carries earth, and him that first promoted the quarrel, till they have given and received mutual wounds, of which they die: For it is thus decreed amongst the brethren, that the more earnestly and vehemently they love one another, if once they begin to hate, they are not to be reconciled, but pursue one another to death, as the most bitter choler is generated from the sweetest honey in a stomach too hot, or the Liver being corrupted. Kill therefore him that is alive, but so, as being dead to quicken him again, otherwise the death of him killed avails you nothing; for death will manifest him, that is to say, after resurrection, and death, darkness, and the sea will fly from him, as Hermes asserts, and the Dragon which observed the holes will avoid the rays of the Sun, and our dead Son lives, and the King comes by fire: Bellinus in his Metaphor in theChapt 3... Rosary signifies the same thing, saying: And let this be done, when you have drawn me partly from my nature, and my wife partly from her nature, you must then also kill the natures, and we are quickened by a new and spiritual resurrection, so that afterwards we cannot die. ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem20.html","doctitle":"Emblem 20","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XX. in 3. infrà.

The common token and symbol, by which the Philosophers know one another, is, that nature is guided, taught, governed, subdued and overcome by nature, as a young Scholar by a Mistress, a waiting maid by her Lady, a subject by a Queen, yea a daughter by the mother, and kinswoman by kinswoman: how true it is, appears by daily experience, in the education of youth amongst men, and other actions, as literary discipline or institution, government, and the like. Pliny writes of the Nightingale, that one teaches, attends, observes, imitates, overcomes another in singing, or being overcome grieves, and that sometimes being outdone and vanquished in the conflict, the throat being broken, it perishes, and in the middle of singing falls down dead: We see also how all sorts of birds do begin to accustom and instruct their young being yet unfeathered and tender for flying, that not only nature, but also art or use has begotten in them the habit of flying, though nature alone gave power and organs to exercise that action, without which neither institution or art can find foundation or place: so colts are taught to run by the mare, whelps to bark by the bitch, and young foxes to craft by the dam, nor is there any animated and sensitive nature or species of nature found, which guides, instructs, and governs not another nature, as its minor, or suffers itself to be overcome by another, as a Parent: We do not perceive such discipline in vegetables, yet notwithstanding the use is observed in them, and that mens hands are of much efficacy: for whilst corn is in the blade, it may be cleansed from incommodious thistles and tares, whilst a tree is yet a twig it may be bent, and made to grow as you please: So in metals and Philosophical subjects one nature keeps, preserves, and defends another nature in fire, as is known to founders and testers, but especially to the masters of natural things: Iron is very helpful and as a midwife to Silver and gold being yet very tender and Spiritual, as they call it, mixed in its mines with Cadmia, Arsenic, or Antimony the chief, if it be cast into mines to be burned in a fire of furnaces: after the same manner iron itself, if it be intended to be changed into Steel, is saved from burning by white stones found at the Sea Shores; Some do cast the powders of crystal glass, or the gall of glass upon metallic powders which are to be dissolved, that they may not perish by over much fire: Instead of this gall of glass the Philosophers do use their Eudica, which Morienus says is also the gall of glass, and to be had in glass vessels: for the heat of fire consumes the body with hasty burning: but Eudica applied will free bodies changed into earth from any burning: For bodies, when now they do not retain their souls, are soon burned: Eudica (the feces of glass) is indeed very agreeable to all bodies, for it vivifies and prepares them, and defends them from all burning: These are the sayings of Morienus the Roman: This therefore is the nature, which teaches another nature to resist fire, and be inured to it, which is the Mistress instructing the 67 young Scholar, and if you consider well, which is the Queen governing the subject, and which is the daughter nobilitating and dignifying the mother; This is that red servant, which is joined in matrimony with his odoriferous mother, and of her begets a progeny far more noble than the parents thereof: This is Pyrrhus the Son of Achilles, and the young man with red hair, golden vestment, black eyes, white feet: This is the knight with a collar or chain armed with sword and buckler against the Dragon, to rescue out of his jaws the pure and unviolated virgin Albifica, surnamed Beja, or Blanca: This is the monsterkilling Hercules, who delivered from the monster Hesione the daughter of Laomedon being exposed to a terrible and cruel Whale: This is that Perseus, who defended (released, and married) Andromeda, the daughter of Cassiope and Cepheus King of Ethiopia, from the Sea monster, Showing the head of Medusa: This is he that may be compared with those ancient Romans the preservers and refiners of the people, Marcus Curtius, Lucius Scævola, Horatius Cocles, Manlius Capitolinus, and the like, to rescue the City, as it were the mother, from dangers: For this is the way and form of nature tending to the perfection of any work, to bring one thing out of another, a thing more perfect out of a thing imperfect, and reduce power into action, but not perfect all things in a moment, but one thing after another: Nor this alone, but she constitutes also her deputy in the first place, to which She leaves the power of life and death, that is, of forming other things, as for example, in the generation of man She uses a long processes, as of ten months, where first attending to the opinion of Aristotle, She fabricates the heart, as the vicar, deputy, or principal bowel, and then the heart delineates, forms, and perfects the other parts necessary to nutrition, the life, senses, and generative power, and communicates to them life and vivific spirits by Systole and diastole, or dilatation and compression of the arteries, so long as it is not impeded by diseases and violence: And thus one nature teaches another, which you must observe and follow for an example of the Philosophical work, as a thing most clear and evident . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem21.html","doctitle":"Emblem 21","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXI. in 4. suprà.

I answer, it is one thing to say, that burning coals are covered under ashes in so great plenty, that if they may only appear by removing the ashes, they are sufficient to boil meat, or warm our cold limbs; it is another thing to affirm, that small sparks only do there lie hid, which, before they can be useful for boiling or warming, must by the industry, art, and care of man bestirred up, quickened, and nourished with fuel, otherwise they may easily be extinguished, and wholly reduced into cold ashes: The last is the assertion of the Aristotelians, the first of the Platonists: With the last agrees reason and experience, with the first only fantasy or imagination: Whereupon it might be demanded, why Plato wrote upon the door of his School, that he that was ignorant of Geometry Should not be admitted into it, he also having affirmed that children actually knew it? are men more unlearned than boys? or have those of full age forgotten those things which boys know? that cannot be supposed: because we see that a brute does by the instinct of nature abhor and avoid the dangers of fire, water, sudden chance, and the like, though newly come into the world, yet that an infant knows not or shuns such things, except hurt, or his finger being a little burnt at the flame of a candle like a Fire=fly, which burns its wings and falls down: why do not the young bee, the fly and gnat fly directly into fire, they not knowing by experience the danger from thence arising? because nature has taught them, but not a child new 70 born. If Geometry be so natural and easy to children, how comes it to pass that the Square of a circle was not known to Plato himself, So that Aristotle the Scholar of Plato affirmed it possible to be known, but not as yet known; but it is evident that it was not unknown to the natural Philosophers, because they command a circle to be converted into a quadrangle, and this, by a triangle, again into a circle: by which they mean a most simple body without angles, as by a quadrangle, the four Elements, as if they Should say, the most simple corporal figure, that can be found, must be taken, and that divided into four elemental colors, and to be a quadrangle equilateral. Now that this quadration is Physical and agreeable to nature, every man understands; by which far more utility accrues to a Commonwealth as also more illustration to the mind of man, than by that Mathematical and merely theoretical or from an abstracted matter: To learn that perfectly, a Geometrician acting about solid bodies must inquire what depth of Solid figures, for example, of Sphere and Cube can be known, and transferred to manual use or practice: If the capacity or circumference of a Sphere be of 32 foot, how much one of the sides of the Cube will be to equalize the capacity of this Sphere, on the contrary, if a Sphere contain 32 measures in so great a circumference, how much will one side of the Cube be, to contain so much, or by looking back from the measures, which the Sphere or Cube contains, to the feet of every circumference: In like manner the Philosophers would have the quadrangle reduced into a triangle, that is, into body, Spirit, and Soul, which three do appear in three previous colors before redness, for example, the body or earth in the blackness of Saturn, the Spirit in a lunar whiteness, as water, the Soul or air in a solar citrinity: then will the triangle be perfect, but this likewise must be changed into a circle, that is, into an invariable redness: By which operation the woman is converted into the man, and made one with him, and the senary the first number of the perfect completed by one, two, having returned again to an unit, in which is eternal rest and peace."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem22.html","doctitle":"Emblem 22","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXII. in 7. suprà.

It would be madness to affirm that gold ever rained upon the earth, except it was allegorically understood: for there are no golden rivers, or Mines of gold veins in the clouds, that it could be said to be there generated, nor is gold of so little weight, as to be thought to be attracted with vapors: but a Trope admits and excuses all these things; for so truly as Pallas actually sprung from Jupiters brain, and Sol committed adultery with Venus, so truly also fell golden rain; not as if we doubt both those things to have happened, but to take away the vulgar and literal sense from things allegorically spoken: for if we follow the bare words of this Emblem, there is nothing more absurd than them, if the meaning, nothing more true. Now Rhodes is an Island, first called Ophiusa by reason of the multitude of Serpents, after that Rhodes from the gardens of roses there flourishing, lastly also Colossicula, from the Colosse of the Sun, which being there was esteemd among the seven miracles of the world: Hereupon the ancient Philosophers, their crude Mercurial matter Showing itself like a Serpent, but after preparation and coction assuming the purple color of a rose, took certain similitudes from the Island Rhodes: The same also was the cause, why they ascribed a golden shower to it, Sol or Apollo having coition with Venus: This thing first tropically spoken gave occasion to the Rhodians (growing more proud, because so great Gods had begotten children among them) to erect as it were an idol of the Sun of stupendous magnitude and charge: for that Colossus, as histories relate, was 70 cubits high, so placed, that Ships might pass between the legs of it with full Sail: the fingers were as big as ordinary statues, and few men could grasp the thumb: the Artist was Chares Lyndius the Scholar of Lysippus, by whom it was made in twelve years: after the fifty sixth year being overturned by an earthquake, it was also a miracle lying: The Sultan of Egypt, winning and possessing Rhodes, is reported to have laden 900 Camels with the brass of this statue: That which Sol is among the Planets, says a Philosopher, that is gold amongst metals; and this is chiefly appropriated to the Sun in respect of heat, color, virtue and essence: for this reason is a golden rain ascribed to the generation of Sol: when little Suns are conceived by Venus: For Venus has a rosy color in her face, and if infused into the seed of Sol, the offspring from hence produced must really be a Rhodian: He is beautiful, like roses, the Son of the Philosophers, who draws and allures the eyes and minds of all men to him, and deserves love, at whose birth it is no strange thing if miracles happen: for he in all his actions will be miraclous, and excite a golden rain: This is the brother of Augius the Son of Sol, 76 who had Oxen for a patrimony, the dung whereof Hercules purged away in one day: He also is the brother of Æeta, who possessed the golden fleece obtained by Jason. Of Pallas proceeding from the brain of Jupiter, without a mother, they report, that she was brought forth at the river Triton, and therefore called Tritonia: She is feigned to be the goddess of wisdom, who springing from the brain, the seat of wisdom, is not without reason so called: a golden rain did also adorn her nativity at Rhodes, that after birth she might remain in the memory of men. In public or solemn joy, as at the coronation of a King, or also the birth of the Kings heir pieces of gold are sometimes thrown amongst the common people, as golden rain: So did the same happen at the birth of Pallas: For Pallas is wisdom, who carries health in her right hand, and riches in the left, and provides for mens health and welfare: To her Persons brought the saxifying head of Medusa, terrible with serpentine and viperous hair, which she used in a shield against her enemies, a rude and barbarous people, transmuting them into stones. And indeed natural wisdom or Philosophy makes those incredulous and envious despisers stupid and void of sense and understanding by that very thing, (from which Chrysaor was produced, who was the father of the tricorporeal Geryon aforesaid), that is, the petrifying Gorgonian blood, which is nothing else, but the tincture of the Philosophical stone . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem24.html","doctitle":"Emblem 24","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXIV. in 5. seu 12. infrà.

It is a thing commonly known, how great the hunger and voracity of a wolf is: neither the ℞ of ♁, nor ♂ are so extreme hungry for when he wants food, in extreme hunger he feeds upon the earth: which also he is said to disgorge, if he come amongst great heards of beasts, that being made more heavy with that pack as it were, he cannot be so easily Shaked off, but resists more strongly and furiously. Having entered into the folds, he not only kills what is sufficient for his belly, but also through greediness destroys the whole flock on every side. He is consecrated to Apollo and Latona, because he stood by her when she was in labor: for neither could Latona have been delivered without the presence of the wolf: and therefore the wolf is not without reason reported to be acceptable to Apollo, whose birthday he celebrated; as also because his eyes do shine and cast forth light by night. The breathless body of the King is cast to him being extreme hungry, not to the end that he should wholly consume and annihilate it, but to restore life and strength to it by his own death: For there is I know not what amatory virtue in the wolves' tail, which is infused into the King being half dead, which makes him very desirable to all men, he restoring pristine health and beauty: The Hyrcanians brought up dogs for no other use, than to devour the bodies of dead men cast to them, as Cicero relates: So also the Massagetæ do give men that die of diseases as prey to dogs: But the Philosophers expose their King to a wolf nor indeed did the custom of the Sabeans please them, in carrying out the corpses of the deceased after the same manner as dung, who also threw their Kings amongst dung hills, nor of the Troglodytes, who tied the neck of a dead man to their feet, and hurried him along with jests and laughter, and without any consideration of the place buried him: But they had rather herein follow the custom of the Magi, who did not bury their bodies, before they were torn to pieces by wild beasts: Or of the Indians, who caused themselves to be buried alive, with Crowns on Singing, the praises of the Gods, lest old age should prevent. but this custom was fatally imposed upon them all without any hope of resurrection, or renovation of life: the Philosophers determine far otherwise: for they have most certain knowledge, that their dead King devoured by the wolf will appear with life, strength, and youth, and the wolf must be burned in his stead: For the wolf may easily be put to death, if he has so gorged his belly, but the King, though dead, has notwithstanding a Martial or Swan=like virtue so as not to be wounded nor consumed: But where must this wolf be sought for, and from whence must the King be had? The Philosophers answer, that the wolf wanders every where in mountains and valleys, to take his prey, who must be drawn out of his harbours, andpreserved for use: The King also coming from the East wearied with a long and tedious journey at length falls down, whose death also grief accelerates, seeing himself in no honor, and so little esteemed amongst strangers and foreigners, as to be sold into servi 79tude for a little money: But the wolf must be had out of a colder region, for those that are bred in a cold climate are more fierce, than in Africa or Egypt, by reason of greater hunger proceeding from external cold: the devoured King does afterwards revive with a Lions courage, who is then able to subdue all wild beasts; and though he be in aspect the meanest amongst his six brethren, that is, the youngest of all, yet will he after many tribulations and miseries at length attain to a most powerful kingdom: Thereupon Says Gratian in the Rosary: In Alchemy there is a certain noble body, which is moved from master to master, in whose beginning will be misery and sharpness, but in the end joy and gladness: and Alanus in the same: One thing is to be chosen and preferred before all, which is of a livid color, having a clear and liquid metallic Species, and is a thing hot and moist watery and adustive, and is a living oil and a living tincture, a Mineral stone and aqua vitæ of wonderful efficacy. It is not always Safe for Kings to travel out of the confines of their kingdoms, for if they abscond and be discovered, they are by their adversaries taken for Spies and imprisoned; if also being detected they proceed without an army they are after the same manner in danger: so also has it happened, or would have happened to this Indian King, death not being prevented. This is the first sublimation, lotion, and nobilitation, which the Philosophers use, that the second and third may be performed with the greater success: for those without this are not of any efficacy, the King being as yet pusillanimous, somnolent, and sick. For he must of necessity first require subsidies and tribute from his subjects, whereby he may purN.B.chase himself garments and other necessaries, and afterwards he will be rich enough, so as to be able to bestow new garments upon all his subjects, so often as he please: for great things for the most part proceeding from small beginnings may then advance small things, or also suppress great things, if they will: as for example, Small Cities at the beginning, which have afterwards governed great Kings, and of villages have made spacious and populous towns . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem25.html","doctitle":"Emblem 25","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXV. in 5. seu 12. infrà.

In acquiring the golden fleece the Dragon was first of all to be killed, because the labor being attempted by many men, they were overcome by the Dragon and destroyed with deadly poison: the reason was, because they were not sufficiently armed against the dragons poison, nor instructed, by what intrigue he might be slain: but Jason (the Physician) neglected no manner of remedies, whereof he received several from Medea (the advice of the mind) and amongst those the images of Sol and Luna, which using he successfully obtained the victory with the reward, that is, the Golden Fleece. The Dragon therefore was slain by Sol and Luna, or the images of them, which the Philosophers do in many places inculcate: for an Author of the Rosary amongst others has it thus: Hermes; The Dragon dies not, except he be killed by his brother and Sister, not by one alone but by both together, to wit, by Sol and Luna. The Philosophers Mercury never dies, except he be killed by his Sister, that is, he must be congealed by Luna or Sol. Note, that the Dragon is Argent vive extracted from bodies, having in it body, Soul, and Spirit, whereupon he says: The Dragon dies not, except by his brother and Sister, that is, Sol and Luna, that is, Sulphur extracted, containing in it the nature of moistness and coldness according to Luna, by those the dragon dies, that is, Argent vive extracted from the same bodies at first, which is the Philosophers Aqua permanens, which is made after putrefaction, and after separation of the Elements, and that water is by another name called Aqua fœtida: these are his words: with whom all the rest do agree, so that there is no need to alleged the authority of every one: the Epyreans worshiped the Dragon in the temple of Apollo in commemoration of Python being slain: War and hatred is genuine to the dragon with the Elephant, whose eyes and throat he strikes at, till the Elephant falling on the ground kills the dragon with himself by the weight of his body, by which means dragons blood is imported into our countries: The Dragon has eyes of the valuation of gems: his sight is very acute and clear, and therefore he is much used for the keeping of treasures, as the apples of the Hesperides, and the golden fleece at Colchos aforesaid: The Ancients ascribed a dragon to Asculapius as a Hieroglyphic: But the Chymists do appropriate dragons to their operations, not indeed really, but allegorically: for a dragon, whether he be fixed or volatile, always denotes Mercury: for this reason Mercury is to be seen with two serpents twisted about his wand (the Dragon being a great Serpent) and Saturn with one, which devours his tail, as also Janus: A Serpent is consecrated to Asculapius the Son of Apollo, the inventor of medicine (Philosophical medicine) in which form he is reported to be brought from Epidaurus to Rome, and there always worshiped for the cessation of the pestilence caused by him, as was supposed: But the Philosophers dragon is always most vigilant and lively, nor easily to be wounded, both by reason of the thickness of his skin, and the sharpness of his teeth and poison, wherewith he is armed: For though common dragons are said to be void of poison, yet this is not without it, venting it upon any one 82 in his way, if he be not warily managed: He can therefore be rarely overcome by force, except the craft of his consanguine relations be also added: For the Poet said truly, It is a safe and usual way to deceive by the name of a friend, yet though it be a safe and usual way, it is a crime, which is so elsewhere, and in other businesses, not here. Jugglers and Mountebanks are said to kill and expel worms out of children by the powder of such other worms, that is, brethren by brothers and Sisters, so here the dragon must be killed by the brother and Sister together, that is, by Sol and Luna: from whence it appears that the dragon is also one of the Planets, to wit, Mercury extracted from bodies, as has been already manifested by the Rosary: Some of the Grecians do affirm, that, in the reign of Herod King of Judea, a dragon fell in love with a marriageable and beautiful maid, and lay with her in bed, and that Tiberius the Emperor delighted in another, which he commonly fed with his own hand: So also the Philosophical dragon, if he be rightly handled, leaves his fierceness, and becomes a friend to man, though he be malicious, if otherwise. Xanthus the historian is a witness with Pliny, that the young of a dragon being killed was restored by the parent to life with the herb, which he calls Balin: which notwithstanding I ascribe to a Philosophical allegory, rather than true history, for life is restored to a dead dragon, and death to a living by course in Chymical processes only: But some man may enquire, where and how the dragon must be taken? The Philosophers answer by a verse most concisely, Dant Rebis montes, dracones, terraꝗ, fontes: But you may see Tacitus of the way of taking him, with what care and industry many men watched to take a mighty dragon observed in Africa, and bring him to the Emperor Tiberius, namely the dragons accustomed way amongst stones being enclosed and by degrees straightened, where he was stopped by nets and cords, and at length made tame by clubs and stripes, and as a burden of many carts brought to a ship, in which he was carried to Rome . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem26.html","doctitle":"Emblem 26","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXIIXXVI. in 8. duplici; infrà.

Tully has excellently described the essential difference of man, whereby he differs from all other animals, after this manner: As a bird is intended by nature for flying, a horse for running, so man for reasoning: For as Lions, bears, and Tigers do exercise and delight themselves in fierceness, Elephants and bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons, and other hawks in the prey of birds, and swiftness of wings; so man excels those and all others in reason, discourse of mind and understanding: so that there is no fierceness, no corporal strength, no celerity, or such like things in beasts so great, as not to be mitigated, subdued, and prevented by reason alone: For reason is not a thing human, or proceeding from the earth, but as the Poet says, a particle of divine breath, sent from heaven into the body of man: but it is sometimes called memory, sometimes the intellectual virtue, to which if use or experience be added, wisdom Springs from thence, which is most precious to man: For use is reported to be as the father, and reason or memory as the mother of so generous an offspring: From whence that common saying: Use begat me, and my mother memory brought me forth: but the question is, what is true wisdom, and most worthy of mans inquisition, there being infinite opinions concerning it, every man interpreting it according to his own imagination? It may be answered, that wisdom in human things (always to be excepted in divine things relating to the welfare of the Soul) consists not in sophistical arguments, not in rhetorical and garnished discoures, not in the poetical sounds of verses, not in the critical subtleties of Grammarians, not in willfullness and obstinacy, in deceits and perjuries, in equivocations and lies, in oppression and sweat of the poor, the craft of heaping up wealth and riches, nor in any thing else, but the true knowledge of Chymistry, together with practice, most commodious to mankind: This is wisdom surpassing all things, which on the right hand goes to the East, on the left to the west, and comprehends the whole earth: Solomon in his book of Wisdom reasons distinctly of wisdom, saying Chapt. 8. v. 9.18.

In the treasures of wisdom is understanding and holy knowledge, and elsewhere he calls it the discipline of sense, or doctrine of the understanding: Concerning this says Morienus the Philosopher: This knowledge is that which draws its owner from the misery of this world, and brings him to the knowledge of good things to come: And that it is the gift of God he himself affirms in these words: God confers this divine and pure knowledge upon his faithful servants, that is to say, those whom he determined from the primitive nature of things to confer it upon through his wonderful generosity: And a little after: For this can be nothing else but the gift of the most high God, who commits and reveals it as he pleases, and also to which of his faithful servants he pleases, they therefore ought to be humble and altogether subject in all things to the omnipotent God: And after: It is convenient also for you, O King, to know that this Magistery is nothing else but the most high and great Gods arcanum and secret of secrets, for this secret he committed to his Prophets, whose souls he has placed in his Paradise: It is also called the tree of life, not that is has eternal life in it, but shows as it were the way to it, and bears fruit wholesome for this life, which it cannot be without, such as are health, the good things of fortune and mind: for without these a man even living is dead, and not much unlike to a brute, though outwardly he represent him that he ought to be, and is not in his better part . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem27.html","doctitle":"Emblem 27","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXVII. in 8. suprà.

Concerning Erichthonius they write, that he sprung from the seed of Vulcan cast upon the earth striving with Pallas the Goddess of wisdom, with serpentine and without human feet. Very like him are those, who, depending upon the means of Vulcan alone, without the wisdom of Pallas, do beget monstrous children, namely, without feet and abortive, which can neither sustain themselves, nor profit others: It is a miserable thing for a man to go on all four, that is, hands and feet together, but much more miserable to be altogether destitute of feet, and to use arms instead thereof: for they seem to have degenerated to the nature of worms, who go after the manner of creeping worms: But the two legs are the organic parts in man, without which he cannot truly walk, as neither see without eyes, or touch things tangible without hands: so likewise Medicine and every operative art is supposed to have two legs, whereon to stand, namely experience and reason, without either of which that art is lame, and imperfect in its traditions and precepts, nor correspondent to the proposed end: Chymistry indeed chiefly delights in two subjects (as legs) whereof one is the key, the other the string of the bar; by these the Philosophical Rosary locked on all sides is opened, and passage admitted into it to those that have right to enter: But if one be wanting to him that is about to enter herein it will be the same thing, as for a man whose feet are bound to endeavor to outrun a hare: he that enters into the garden, which is every way enclosed or fenced, without a Key, imitates a thief, who coming in a dark night can discern nothing that grows in the garden, nor enjoy the things stolen away: But the key is a thing of very little esteem or value, which is properly called a stone known in the chapters, and is the root of Rhodes, without which a twig is not put forth, nor does the bud swell, nor the Rose become green, or discover multitude of leaves: But a question might be asked, where must this key be sought for? I anwser with the oracle, that is must be there investigated, where the bones of Orestes are said to be found, namely, where winds, the Striker, that which is beaten back, and the destruction of men are found together, that is, as Lychas has interpreted it, in the Brasiers Shop or workhouse: For the oracle would have bellows understood by winds; a hammer by the striker an anvil by that which is beaten back; by the destruction of men iron: if a man knows how to number well and distinguish the signs, he will certainly find this key in the northern hemisphere of the Zodiac, and the string of the bar in the Southern: Which having obtained, it will be easy to open the door and enter: and in the very entrance he will see Venus with her Paramour Adonis: for she has tinged the white roses of a purple color with her blood: In the same place also a dragon is observed, as in the Hesperian gardens, which watches to preserve the roses: The scent of the roses is said to be increased by garlic planted near, and that by reason of an exceeding degree of heat, which appears in garlic, in which respect it is a remedy against cold poisons: for Roses 88 require the heat of the Sun and earth, before they can attain to color and scent most grateful to the eyes and nose: Moreover the fume of common Sulphur makes red roses white, where it touches, on the contrary the spirit of Vitriol or Aqua fortis restores them to a deep red color, which endures: For common Sulphur is an enemy to the Philosophical Sulphur, though it cannot destroy it, but the Solutive water is friendly, and preserves its color: The rose is consecrated to Venus in regard of beauty, in which it surpasses all other flowers: for it is a Virgin, which nature has armed, that it might not be violated without revenge and punishment: Violets are void of weapons, and trodden under foot; Roses being comprised within prickles have yellow hair inwardly; and outwardly a green garment: No man can pluck, and separate them from the prickles but he that is wife [sic], if otherwise, he will feel a sting in his fingers: So none but a most wary Philosopher will pluck the flowers, except he would find bees and stings in the hives, and gall with honey. Many men have secretly and feloniously entered into the Rosary, but reaped nothing from thence but misery; that is, lost their labor. Hereupon Says Bacusser in Turba; Our books seem to be very injurious to those, who read our writings only once, twice, or thrice, whereas being frustrated in their understanding and whose study, they also (which is worst) lose their money, pains, and time, if they have spent any in this art.

As there are three concoctions in man, the first in the Stomach, the second in the Liver, the third in the veins, so also so many are the universal evacuations of the excrements, which are correspondent to them, and daily carry off their superfluities, namely the first by Stool, which is proper to the first concoction, the second by urine, which appertains to the second, the third by expiration through the pores of the whole body, or by sweat, which is peculiar to the third: In the first the Chyle, in the next the Chyme, in the last a dew or dewy substance is elaborated, and applied to every part of the body: The recrements or feces of the first are thick, bilious, and fat, which are carried through the bowels to the back door, and if they be at any time obstructed, they are moderately or strongly expelled by gentle purgatives; the excrements of the second are liquid, more thin, bilious and saltish, which are brought out of the veins by the kidneys and bladder, as conduits, and the sediment of these is the sign or touchstone of urine: The superfluities of the third are yet more thin, and therefore do for the most part expire of themselves through the smallest pores, or are carried out together with the serum of the humors, as sweat: These are helped by sudorifics, as the antecedent by diuretics: To evacuate these last feces the ancient Greeks and Romans were very solicitous: For to this end were so many sports and exercises used by them, as chafing of all the parts in the morning, anointing with oil, and wrestling, fencing, the exercise of running, of handball, tennis, daily washing and bathing in rivers or artificial baths, for the conveniency of which were so many magnificent structures built at Rome, that we can rather admire than imitate them: As for example the baths of Dioclesian, which for the most part are yet remaining, and (if I be not mistaken) portrayed with Archangels, so high, sumptuous, and splendid were the works: The sorts of concoctions in the elaboration of metals are almost the saine, as those aforesaid: for the first is in its way effected in annus magnus, that is, the revolution of the highest Sphere, the second in the revolution of the lowest, the third in the revolution of themiddle Sphere: But the Philosophers to draw forth this mass of excrementitious superfluities more commodiously by the ministery of art, do invent also several ways, as ablutions, purgations, balneations and laconica, by which they have performed that in the Philosophical work, which Physicians have in mans body: Duenech therefore is introduced into the bath by Pharut, there to sweat, and evacuate the feces of the third concoction through the pores: Now this Kings distemper is melancholic or atrabilary, whereby he is of less authority and esteem than all other princes, being taxed with the morosity of Saturn, and the choler or passion of Mars: he has therefore a desire either to die or be cured, if it be possible: Amongst many Physicians one being found, who undertook this charge 9i upon himself, he was brought with entreaties and rewards: And this Allegory is very frequent in the writings of the Philosophers, as of Bernard, Alanus, in the treatise of Duenech, and innumerable others; we therefore add no other circumstances which might be derived from them: it is sufficient here to have observed, the excrement of which coction may be evacuated by balneation: for herein consists the substance of the whole matter: Heat included in the body is commonly reduced to the superficies of the skin together with the blood in hot stoves or baths, whereby a beautiful complexion is acquired to the face and whole body; which if it appear, will be a sign, that the melancholic blackness, which infects the skin, may by degrees be evacuated, and all the humors corrected, that pure and rosy blood may afterwards be generated: The whole temperament of his body must necessarily be amended, because it resists good blood, and is cold and dry, that on the contrary being hot and moist, which whether it can be done or no, it is convenient for a Physician to foreknow and foretell by prognostics: Some men are found who have taken Cerdon for the great Prince or Kings Son, but they have at length by certain signs perceived what he was in descent and education: lest this should happen, the artist must be careful in the first place to choose the true offspring of the King, which though he be not in splendid and golden attire, but in despicable and mean clothing, as also of a livid and melancholic complexion, let him not therefore reject him, or take another in his room; for if he be very well washed, his royal genius will soon appear, as in Cyrus, Paris, Romulus, who were educated amongst rustics: But by way of observation the bath must be a Laconicum, that is, vaporous and sudorific, that the water may not burn his tender flesh, or obstruct the pores, whereby more damage than utility would ensue, and his malady not be cured: As for the Kings garments to be put on after bathing let no man be solicitous; for as the daughter of King Alcinous did in times past contribute clothes to Ulysses being shipwrecked and naked, so will there be one that will send him most precious robes, that he may deservedly be acknowledged the Son of Sol . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem29.html","doctitle":"Emblem 29","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXIX. in 9 seu infrà.

Two Elements there are, in which animals live, water and air, and as many in which no animated thing can live, earth and fire: For as those are of a middle and temperate complexion in the first and second qualities, so these are extreme; bodies either too thick or too subtle, so thick as not to admit other bodies, so subtle as indeed to admit, but to penetrate and burn them: But the reason why men do live in vaults and subterranean Mines is because of the air descending thitherto, and supplying the vacuity of those places: But here we speak of every Element apart: In water fish do live in incredible number, variety, and fertility, yea the greatest of all animals; In the air men, fourfooted beasts, birds, worms, and insects: Whatsoever is said of Spirits wandering in the secret parts of the earth, is another thing, for neither are they animals: But they say the Salamander alone lives in fire: Now the Salamander is a creeping vermin, not much unlike to a Lizard, but of Slower pace, bigger head, and different color, such as I remember I have seen in the Alps, or neck of Spluga, coming out of the caverns of rocks after thunder and rain, and staying in the way, a countryman of that place advertising that it was, called ein Molch: And it had about a clammy and viscous moistness, by the virtue of which it passes freely through fire without harm: But the Philosophers Salamander is much different, though it be assimilated to this: For that is bred in fire, this not; but if it falls into fire it is not presently burned by reason of its exceeding coldness and moistness, but can freely pass through the flame: That is hot and dry this cold and moist: For every thing participates of the nature of the mothers womb, or resembles the place and country: Fire produces nothing but that which is hot and dry, as its like, and on the contrary the moist and cold caverns of rocks, being full of water, do bring forth this cold and moist vermin. That does by the similitude of nature rejoice in fire, this by contrariety extinguishes it, or repells its force for some time from it. They say that the fly called Pyrausta is generated in fire, and flies out of the brass furnaces of Cyprus: but no man has believed this true, except by an allegory: For fire, if it be continued, destroys and corrupts the bodies of all animals whatsoever, it also burning the earth into glass, and the most solid timber into ashes, and all other compounded things, a few excepted, as Mercurial, which do either wholly remain, or altogether fly from fire, no separation of the parts being made in them: Vulcan is a most cruel murderer, who calls all things mixed with the Elements to his examination, some being excepted from his judgement seat as the privileges, and prerogatives of the Emperess Nature: Upon these he obtains no right alone, unless he join to himself other 94 judges, and Salamanders are above his violence, which they do not fear: Avicenne in Porta reckons up the various temperaments of bodies, which are all unequal, and therefore corruptible by fire and other injuries: but one he affirms to be exactly equal, which has so much heat, as cold, so much siccity, as moisture, not as to weight, but justice, as the Physicians term it, and this is that which is more patient, than agent; in which if fire endeavors to dissolve water its contrary into air its familiar, the earth admits not this resolution, because it is incorporated with water: and the internal fire of the compound does by consent approve this sentiment of the earth, because it is an intimate friend to the earth. The judgment therefore of Vulcan ceases, who uses yet another intrigue, striving to burn the earth into ashes, as his custom is, but the water adhering to it prevails against exceptions, which Shows itself united to the earth, and the air to it, and fire to the earth on the other side; he therefore that would incinerate the earth, must also incinerate the other Elements: And so Vulcan being disappointed suspends his judgment, lest he Should be derided by all men. This body is like the real Salamander, in which the Elements are exactly equalized in virtue: Of it Says the Rosary out of Geber; That Philosopher would have the substance of Mercury mortified, but naturally his Mercury is in that venerable Stone, as is manifest to all men: therefore etc. Also that Philosopher would have the substance of Mercury fixed, as is evident, because he teaches the ways of fixing with many cautions and devices, but who doubts the substance of that precious stone to be fixed? certainly no man that knows it. By which it is demonstrated, that the Stone must be reduced to the nature of the Salamander by fixation; that is, to absolute fixity, which declines not, or refuses fire. For neither can it be the Salamander, before it has learned to endure fire most patiently, which must of necessity be effected in long process of time. Hereafter in the 35 emblematical discourse we will treat of Achilles and Triptolemus, placed in the night time under embers of fire, till they could endure most vehement heat, who also attained to a Salamandrine property by custom and habit: for custom is a second nature, which notwithstanding must communicate power, and as a Mistress begin alteration, otherwise custom will be able to effect little or nothing; that is the reason why it is impossible to fix ice at fire, but Cristal possible, because nature has begun this: The same must be supposed of watery and volatile Mercury, which in its own nature cannot be fixed, except by marriage and coition with Sulphur, which is the Philosophers tincture, and fixes all volatile Spirits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem30.html","doctitle":"Emblem 30","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXX. in 7 seu 14 infrà.

Or can I Luna Natures gifts express Without your aid? no, grant me some redress. He's but a fool those to confine apart Whom Nature would have joined in mind and heart.","discourse-en":"Discourse 30. Avicenne in his book of the Soul diverse times admonishes, that no eggs are to be taken for art, but only of those hens, which had a cock: that is, the feminine subject avails nothing without the masculine virtue, and on the contrary, nor a cock profitable without a hen: for both these sexes must be joined together in the Philosophical coop, that multiplication may be made: The Philosophers do indeed use the similitude taken from a cock, because in the first place he is more correspondent to the power of Sulphur, than any other male of birds, one being able to serve many hens, and not easily suffering a rival in the same dunghill, thinking himself convenient and sufficient for everyone. He is the bird of Mars, transformed, as the Poets fable, from the youth Gallus, who was entrusted to observe Sol, that he might not discover the adultery of Mars with Venus, and very Martial in fight, contending with his adversary even to death: In the Philosophical work he represents Sol, as the hen does Luna: there is therefore the same necessity of joining Sol with Luna, as a cock with a hen: The cock is also consecrated to Sol, at whose approach he rises, and goes to sleep with him: he often looks up to heaven, and erects his hooked tail upright: he fights against Serpents in defense of his hens: he is an acceptable messenger of light and Latona being present at her labor: Latona indeed brought forth Sol and Luna, and therefore he is appropriated to the mother and Son: But Sol, Luna, and Latona do in Chymical subjects agree, so also the cock and hen: but these also proceeded from an egg, and again do lay eggs for the production of young chickens; so also do the Philosophers eggs turn into birds of the same kind, provided they be kept warm with temperate heat, as is the heat of a brooding hen, which endures continually: For whereas amongst other birds the male also sits upon the eggs, the cock alone shows himself free from this office or burden; and therefore all the care and pains of hatching the eggs, and producing chickens lies upon the hen; where her sedulity and diligence may be observed, how hastily She eats and drinks, and unloads her belly, and presently runs back to her eggs, before they be cold: Then with what force and violence She defends her chickens, with what tenderness She receives and covers them being naked under her wings, with what a voice, as with a bell, She calls and keeps them together, with what study She breaks the harder crumbs or seeds for them, and presents them with her beak, as on a knife, this work of nature is worthy of admiration. And all these things are, that man may neither want eggs nor chickens for aliment: After the same manner the Philosopher or artist does most diligently and providently 97 proceed in all his operations; For he picks up eggs there where a cock has been, trying them whether they be adle, after that he cleanses prepares, and disposses them in his vessels, as nests, and administers due heat, whereby the subjects mixed together daily act and suffer one by another, till after a long time passing through various colors they come to one color and essense: In which operation Solution, coagulation, Sublimation, ascension, descension, distillation, calcination and fixion as intermediate are perfected: for a hard and compact thing cannot be altered, therefore Solution is premised, that is may be made liquid and soft: and where a thing is dissolved, it is convenient also to be coagulated, not to its former hardness but a honeyish tractability; Sublimation separates the pure from the impure, and makes a thing vile more worthy, the inferior superior; and therefore this neither ought to be wanting, for it is as the mistress and directness of all: when sublimation is made, some parts ascend higher, which is ascension, and others again descend, and so descension is made: Distillation also clarifies the whole being often interposed, and that which remains in the bottom is calcined: then both are fixed, and so the work is completed. But if a man gather all these particular operations under a general, which is Coction, he will not err much from the purpose: for as so many chickens as there are, which run here and there dispersedly, do resort to one mother or nurse the hen, so do so many several ways of operating concur to the womans work, that is, coction alone: It is Luna, which comes to be exalted to the sublimity of Sol, for whose sake all these things are done, that is, durable matrimony is intended between Sol and Luna, which if effected, all legations, desponsations, copulations, dubitatious, etc. will cease, and the bed and flesh of both will be one, mutual and constant love, eternal peace, and an indissoluble alliance: Sol without Luna is of no great esteem, and Luna without Sol of mean and sordid condition: But She receives splendor, and dignity, with strength or constancy of mind and body from Sol her husband, and Sol from Luna multiplication of offspring, and propagation of kind: hereupon Says the Rosary: If only one of them Should be in our stone, the medicine would never flow easily, nor, yield the tincture, and if it should yield, it would not tinge, unless for so much as also the remainder would be, and the Mercury would evaporate in fume, because the receptacle of the tincture would not be in it: And Geber in his book of examinations proves, that if Sol and Luna be incorporated together with art, they are not easily separated . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem31.html","doctitle":"Emblem 31","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXI. in 4. suprà.

The first rudiments of all discipline were anciently the knowledge of swimming, and instruction in learning: hereupon because the proverb of an ignorant and unpolished man, that he could neither swim nor read: For the Ancients considered swimming as a means often times to save and deliver the body from the dangers of water, and the knowledge of learning the mind from the waves of fortune: Moreover swimming is very serviceable in time of war, the knowledge of learning in time of peace at home: And as we observe that brutes have their weapons in readiness, provided by nature, man hands and wit administered instead thereof against external violence, wit to contrive and invent weapons, hands to make and use them, so is the faculty of swimming naturally invested in the same beasts, but not in man: they even young do often escape out of waters by swimming, in which a man though old or never so strong is suffocated; Needful therefore it was to enjoin the exercise of swimming to children, being often times most conducible to preserve a mans life, that that which was wanting by nature, might be supplied by the use of art: The same exercise have Noblemen, Princes, and Kings used for the safeguard of their body, for those descended from noble blood are not wholly exempt from the chances of fortune, but exposed to them as well as other men: If Dionysius had known neither swimming nor learning, when he was driven out of the kingdom of Sicily as a tyrant, he had perished by the waves of the Sea being Shipwrecked in the Corinthian gulf, but escaping the dangers by swimming, he went to Corinthus, where he set up a school to teach boys, and professed human learning, of a King being made a Schoolmaster, and holding a rod in stead of a Scepter, from whence that jeering Proverb, Dionysius of Corinth: In like manner if the royal Son of the Philosophers had not been able to swim, no man would have heard his voice, nor relieved him, being long since drowned in the waters: swimming therefore is necessary and commodious to all degrees of men: for though it cannot deliver a man presently from the surges of the vast ocean, yet it gives time of life, whereby he may be saved by others: But the said King sustains himself a long time, and cries out hitherto, though he be heard or seen by very few by reason of the largeness of the Sea, and remoteness of it: for by chance he has touched upon a rock or great stone in swimming, by which to be preserved, if the waves prevail. But the question is what is the Sea? I answer, the Erythaean or red sea, subject to the Tropic of Cancer, in which, there being great store of Magnets in the bottom, it is not safe for Ships compacted or laden with iron to sail: for they might easily be drawn to the bottom by the virtue of the Magnet: which the said King being ignorant of, and the rest perishing the Ship being sunk, he alone escaped by swimming. His Crown shining with orient Rubies continued with him, by which he might easily be known, and restored to his 100 kingdom: But what are those good things, which this royal Son is able or willing to confer on him, by whom he Should be restored to his own kingdom? certainly not such, as Ptolemy the last King of Egypt bestowed on Pompey, by whom his father was restored to the kingdom of Egypt, to wit, perfidiousness and death, but health, the removal of diseases, the preservation of life from them, the use of things necessary, and the horn of plenty, honor and love; which not being vulgar or mean things, but the chief viatics and ornaments of this life, who, but a man of lead, would not desire them? who would not stretch forth his hand, and draw him into the boat? but he must see that in helping him his Diadem fall not into the sea: for then he could scarce be known for the King, nor received by his subjects, because the venerable Pyropus would perish, because the Bezoar Stone, assuring health to all men, would be lost: The Rosary alluding hereto cites Aristotle in these words: Chose you a Stone, by which Kings are revered in their Diadems, and by which Physicians can cure their patients, because it is near to fire: for without a medicinal virtue a Crown would be of no value. But what must be done to the King now delivered? he must be freed from the water which he received in by Sudorifics, from cold by the heat of fire, from numbness and stupefaction of the parts by baths moderately hot, from hunger and want of food by the administration of convenient diet, and from other external maladies by their contraries even wholesome remedies: Then he must be provided of royal matrimony, and in due time a most hopeful heir will be generated by him, most acceptable to all men, most beautiful and most fruitful, who will excel all his Ancestors in power, kingdoms, dominions, people, wealth and riches, and will subject his enemies to himself, not by war, but humanity, not by tyranny, but clemency, which is genuine and peculiar to him . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem32.html","doctitle":"Emblem 32","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXII. in 5. suprà.

The Philosophers call their Stone vegetable, because it vegetates, grows, is increased and multiplied as a plant: which indeed to the ignorant seems strange and contrary to truth; it being manifest that stones do neither vegetate, nor grow after this manner, nor any thing at all relate to liquable metals: but they are deceived in their judgment: for that which is unknown to them they suppose is not in rerum natura, measuring the immensity of the universe by their capacity: For who could ever have believed that a stone should grow under water, or a plant there generated become a stone, if experience together with the credible testimonies of writers had not confirmed it? where is that petrifying, where that tinging virtue, which hardens and tinges Coral, whether in the water, or in the air, or in the earth? we may reasonably believe it to be, as they affirm, a soft and flexible plant, whilst it is under water, yet of a very terrestrial nature, which, when it is cut off and exposed to the cold winds, becomes hard, and acquires a stony frangibility, the watery parts abounding being dried up by the cold and dry air (for these North winds blowing do introduce siccity) and the terrestrial body remaining congealed with cold and siccity being the qualities of the earth: for constriction appertains to the earth alone, not to the water, nor air, as to the proper and genuine virtues of either. Besides the sea in other places yields three medicinal stones deduced partly from the vegetable kind, partly from the animal, or rather partly from the secrets of nature; as Pearls, Amber, and Ambergris: the production of Pearls, and the way of taking them have been known to us, but not of the rest: Amber is found and gathered on the Sea coasts of Sudavia, on the shores, after a most vehement South or westerly wind, which without doubt boils out of the veins of the earth into the Sea, or is washed out by the water, and driven by the waves to the shores: For we have seen some veins of iron and Silver swimming with the Amber, which could not be done but in the earth. But as to the flies, gnats, Spiders, Butterflies, frogs, Serpents which are seen in some pieces (as we have had 120 beads turned out of Amber, which did every one contain some flies, gnats, Spiders, butterflies, and one particle nine, not without a singular miracle of nature) that happens by the influence and imagination of the heaven; as we have elsewhere demonstrated. That Ambergris is found after the same manner on the Shores of the east and west Indies, cannot be denied, and though some declare it to be the juice or gum of trees, as the Amber aforesaid, yet they that conceive it to proceed out of veins of the earth do judge more probably: For fruitful trees of Amber have been in no place seen, which notwithstanding, if there be, do most certainly grow out of the water in the open air: We 103 therefore ascribe both sorts of Amber to subterranean veins or stones, as Pearls to Zoophytes (that is, a middle nature between animal and plant) and Coral to vegetables. The Philosophers stone is indeed like to these stones and especially to Coral: for as Coral grows in water, and draws nutriment from the earth; so also the Philosophical stone growes in Mercurial water, and from it receives whatsoever is earthy, for the augmentation of itself, the superfluous moisture expiring. A red color is also fixed in Coral by coagulation, which modern authors call the tincture of Corals, no otherwise than as in the Physical stone, which becomes red in the last coagulation of it, and appears like the reddest Coral, which is the tincture: but as Coral becomes hard by cold and siccity, so that by heat and siccity, which being augmented it likewise dissolves, contrary to the nature of other stones, which do indeed , but turn into glass, which thing is nowise agreeable to this: And as Coral is prepared into several medicines of great virtue, so also has the Philosophical Coral transferred the virtues of all herbs into itself, so that is alone is able to perform as much as all the medicines of all vegetables: For the celestial Sun, which infuses medicinal virtue and efficacy into vegetables, contributes to this its Son and terrestrial deputy more, than to all others: This is the Philosophical vegetable, animal, and mineral Coral, which lies occult in the vast ocean, and is not known, except it be exposed to the eyes and put into the hands of the ignorant: But it must be cut off in the water with very great caution, lest it lose its juice and blood, and nothing remain but a terrestrial chaos without its true form: For herein consists all the difficulty of taking coral, besides which there is scarce any: The superfluous moisture. I mean, which kills the stone, unless it be separated, which suffers not the coraline redness to appear, which admits not coagulation, whilst it is therein . . . . .

It is one of the secrets of Nature, that in the cold winter Frogs and Horseleeches lie as it were dead under water, and in the Spring new heat of the Sun operating recover sense and motion, or perform the actions of a sensitive life: But if they be found in the waters in the winter time, and brought into the air or a warm house, they presently begin to move themselves, as in the Summer: From whence it appears, that they want nothing but external heat, to excite the natural internal heat, and bring it to action: After the same manner do the Philosophers speak of their Hermaphrodite, who, if he appears dead lying in darkness, requires the heat of fire: Now he is said to lie in darkness, being left in a dark and most cold winters night, that is, remaining in blackness, which is a sign of coldness, from which he ought to be brought to whiteness by a greater intension of fire, and by yet a greater, to redness: For, as Bodillus in Turba says, nothing is generated without heat, and a bath of vehement heat causes a body to perish, if it be cold it drives it away, but if it be temperate, it becomes agreeable and pleasant to the body. Bonellus in the same says, All things that live do also (God so pleasing) die: that nature therefore, which is deprived of moisture, being exposed by night, seems like a dead man, and then that nature requires fire, till the body and Spirit of it be turned into earth, and then it becomes dust like to a dead man in his tomb: these things being accomplished God restores a Spirit and Soul to it, and all infirmity being taken away our nature is comforted and amended: It is therefore requisite to burn that matter without fear etc. Fire therefore, which destroys all other things, repairs this, that which yields death to others gives life to this. One only Phoenix there is, which is restored by fire, which is renewed by flames, and revives out of ashes, and this being known to the Philosophers only is burnt and restored to life, whatsoever other men dream of a bird, I know not what, that flies, residing nowhere, nor seen, but as a fable. The Hermaphrodite, of which the Philosophers speak, is of a mixed nature, male and female, whereof one passes into another by the operation of heat, for the female is converted into a male, which ought not to seem so strange in the Philosophers work, it being found, if we may believe histories, that many men have also changed their sex: The Poets make mention of Ceneus, Iphis, and Tiresias, as Pontanus in the Stars. Pœniteat generis tamen et se Cenea malint, Aut in fœmineam penitùs transire figuram: And Ausonius: Mœret in antiquam Ceneus revocata figuram. So in the Consulship of Licinius Crassus, and Caius Cassius Longinus 106 at Cassinum a boy was made of a Virgin: And Licinius Mutianus in Pliny relates, that he had seen one Aristontes at Argos, called also by the name of Aristusa, who was married, and soon after discovered a beard and virility, and married a wife: Pliny himself says that in Africa he saw Lucius Cossicius a Citizen of Tisdritane changed into a woman on the day of marriage: certain it is that these things are true, and might be proved by many other examples, if need were: but the genital or virile parts are thrust out of the body by the increase of heat: For a woman being much colder than a man, and having inwardly those things absconded, which a man has outwardly, as Physicians say, hereupon Nature being dubious, whether She Should generate a man or a woman, has expressed a woman outwardly, though inwardly she conceived a man: for which reason heat and motion increasing through age the hidden parts broke forth, and showed themselves visibly to all men: After the same manner with the Philosophers the woman is turned into a man heat being increased, that is, the Hermaphrodite looses the female sex, and becomes a man stout and grave, having nothing in him of effeminacy or levity. So we some time since saw a noble youth an Hermaphrodite changed or rather promoted (by the industry of the Surgical art performed by that most famous Physician Caspius Tagliacotius of Bononia) into a perfect man, fit (as was desired) for the generating of an offspring, a new hole being made through the yard, which was wanting there, and the lower as appertaining to the woman being stopped up. The Philosophers are not without all these manual operations: for when the coldness and moistness of Luna appears, that they call the woman, when the heat and siccity of Sol, the man; when all those four qualities together, their Rebis or Hermaphrodite; And thus conversion of the woman may easily be made, that is, the mutation of coldness and moistness, into the man, which is done by the sole heat of fire, as has been said; for heat sequesters, and separates the superfluities of moistures, and will establish the idea of itself in the Philosophical subject, which is the tincture . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem34.html","doctitle":"Emblem 34","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXIV. in 8. infrà.

The opinion or flattery of men attributes wonderful births to some persons above others, but certainly fabulous, as to Alexander the great, begotten not by Philip King of Macedonia, but Jupiter Hammon; to Romulus and Remus, by Mars; to Plato, born of the virgin Perictione violated by the image of Apollo: so the Heathen would demonstrate themselves to proceed from the Gods, as also Thessalus the Son of Hippocrates the Physician does amongst other things endeavor to persuade himself to descend from Apollo at Athens: but we cannot easily believe them, who know, that they were neither men nor Gods, to whom they refer the original of their lineage: And if the Heroes were amongst men as divine, we conceive all those magnificent actions boasted in the world, through the adulation of Subjects, disciples, or others, were things feigned of them, and insinuated into the opinion of the vulgar by forged writings: The thing is different, that the Philosophers ascribe an unsual conception and nativity to their Son; for he has something peculiar above all other things born in the world, he being conceived in baths, and born in the air. We know that women being barren through overmuch coldness and siccity may be much helped by hot baths, so as to be made able and fit for conception, but that it should be done in baths is a thing unheard of: that seems to appertain to him alone, by reason of the wonderful power of nature far different from other things. they elsewhere say, that he must be conceived in the bottom of the vessel, and born in the Alembic: which opinion is more conspicuous: For the waters of baths, if there be any, will not be at the top, nor in the middle, but in the bottom of the vessel, and in the Alembic are airy vapors: where therefore conception is made, he ascends into the Alembic, and his birth appears in a white color: Blackness rules in the bottom, concerning which says the Rosary; Conception is, when the earth is dissolved into a black powder, and begins to retain somewhat of the Mercury; for then the male acts upon the female, that is, Azoth upon the earth. And a little after: Conception and desponsation is made in putrefaction in the bottom of the vessel, and the generation of things generated will be made in the air, to wit, in the head of the vessel, that is, the Alembic: And conception in baths is nothing else but putrefaction in dung: for so the same Rosary continues: The body does nothing, unless it be putrified, and it cannot be putrefied, except with Mercury: And soon after: Putrefaction must be effected with a most gentle heat of warm and moist dung, and by no other thing, so that nothing ascend, because if any thing should ascend, there would be a separation of the parts, which ought not to be, till the male and female be perfectly joined together, and one receive the other, the sign of which perfect solution is blackness in the superficies. His birth is white, which is consummated at the top 109 of mountains, that is, in the air or Alembic; which is by Rosinus to Euthicia thus explained: The wise man said. Take things out of their mines, and exalt them to higher places, and send them from the top of their mountains, and reduce them to their roots: And afterwards: But by mountains he signified Cucurbits, and by the tops of mountains Alembic: and to send is according to similitude to receive the water of them by an Alembic in a Receiver: and to reduce to the roots, is to that, from which they proceed: and he named Cucurbits mountains, because Sol and Luna are found in mountains: so also in the mountains, which are Cucurbits, are their Sol and Luna generated: These are his words: Afterwards he becomes red, and begins to go upon the waters, that is, upon metals melted by fire, which stand in the form of a mercurial water: For he is the lord of waters, upon which he exercises authority, as Neptune, and is the king of the Sea, and the possessor of mountains. Of Xerxes King of Persia they report, that being upon an expedition into Greece, he sent an embassy to the Sea, and to the mountain Athos, that they would do him no wrong, that by the force of waves, this of fire, otherwise that he would take revenge upon them both: But the tale was told to them that were deaf, and the Sea drowned some of his ships, and Athos destroyed not a few by fire. Hereupon the King being angry, did, as lord fo the Sea and mountains, command a certain number of stripes to be inflicted upon the first, and a great part of the mountain he cast into the sea: but these things do demonstrate the rashness rather than the prudence of so great a king: He, of whom we speak, purges all waters from obstacles; and impurities, not by edict, but fact, and freely passes through them, which also (which is more) he congeals, so as by their hardness to bear his chariots, in which ships sailed before: He makes mountains equal with valleys, and fears not the flames of fire, and therefore goes freely wheresoever he please, from the pillars of Hercules in the farthest parts of India, to the pillars of Dionysius . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem35.html","doctitle":"Emblem 35","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXV. in 7. suprà.

Haec eadem asscribuntur Osiridi, qui ideò terrarum orbem perlustravit, ut alibi demonstravimus, Dionyso, qui vini u-sum homines docens peregrinatus est per mundum: Sunt verò hi tres Triptolemus, Osiris Dionysius unius intentionis officii, i-mò res una; ut etiam Achilles, qui fortissimus ad bellum Trojanum mittendus erat; Ejus pater Peleus, id est, terra, vel Peleus mons, ma-ter Thetis dea marina seu aquarum; his nascitur Achilles: At in eorũeorum nuptiis pomum aureum Eridos prolatum est, prima causa belli Tro-jani, unde ex iis nuptiis natus, non immeritò ejus executor extitit: Induratus verò eodem modo Achilles à matre sua dicitur, quo an-tedictus Triptolemus à Cerere; de quo liblibro 6.

Lycurgus that Lawmaker of the Spartans Showed to the people in an assembly in the Theater by an ocular example, how far custom and use whether good or evil may prevail, he bringing in two whelps produced at one litter, and between both setting a pot full of meat, and a hare, one of which whelps seeing the food and the hare, left the food and pursued the hare, because he was so accustomed, but the other not regarding the hare, emptied the pot, he being also so accustomed: which being done, behold, says he, here you see by little ones, how far education and custom may prevail, even in those, which nature has produced exactly alike, and of the same litter: After this manner therefore is it convenient to rectify or direct nature to better things, which is as wax, easily flexible to vice or virtue. That which he has demonstrated to be true in politics, the Philosophers do agree to be also so in Physics. How effectual custom is in men and brutes daily examples are seen throughout the whole world, in vegetables also are many obvious, but in mineral and metallic bodies we have not so much experience: yet nevertheless they fix their stone by custom in fire agreeable to it, as they in innumerable places do signify: For it must be nourished by fire, as a child by milk upon its mothers breasts: whereupon says Emiganus; behold the babe sucking, and hinder him not: And Bodillus, The infant born is nourished by milk and fire alone, and by little and little whilst he is very young, and the more he is burned, his bones being comforted, he is brought to youth, to which attaining, he is able to provide for himself: And Arnold in the Rosary booke 2. Chapt 7. Yet the Medicine must be a long time roasted by fire, and nourished as a child with the breasts. These same things have the most ancient Philosophers been pleased to demonstrate by the allegories of Triptolemus and Achilles accustomed to lie and being hardened in fire, they both denoting nothing else but the Chymical subject, besides which the fable would be insignificant and absurd, unworthy either to be appropriated to other moral things, or inculcated to the ears of the learned: Ceres did as a Nurse feed Triptolemus in the day time with milk, and in the night laid him in fire, whereupon the youth being very well nourished, his father Eleusius at length took notice of it: hereupon Ceres killed Eleusius, and gave the youth Triptolemus a chariot drawn with winged Dragons, whereby he passed through the air into all parts of the world, and taught men how to sow corn: But this Triptolemus is the tincture nourished by fire after a Philosophical manner, which being drawn by Serpents, that is, Mercury, taught men how the 112 Philosophers seeds are to be cast into their earth. These same things are ascribed to Osiris, who to that end took a view of the whole world, as we have elsewhere demonstrated, and to Dionysius, who travelled throughout the world teaching men the use of wine: Now these three Triptolemus, Osiris, and Dionysius are of one intention and office, yea one thing; as also Achilles, who being most valiant was to be sent to the Trojan war; his father was Peleus, that is, earth, or the mountain Peleus, his mother Thetis goddess of the Sea or waters; from these Achilles descended: But at their nuptials the golden apple of Eris was produced, the first cause of the Trojan war, wherefore proceeding from those nuptials reason there was that he should determine it: Achilles is said to be hardened by his mother after the same manner as the aforesaid Triptolemus by Ceres, concerning whom we have said enough in the 6th book of Hieroglyphics, which here to repeat we think superfluous. The nutriment therefore of the Stone is fire, but it is not thereby (as some may falsely imagine) extended into longitude, latitude, and profundity, nor does it receive increment in weight; because it acquires only virtue, maturation, and color from fire, carrying all the rest with it as viatics provisions: For when its parts are from several places congested, purged, and conjoined, it has in it all things requisite for it: Whereupon says a Philosopher in the Rosary. Omnia fert Secum quibus indiget hæc aqua fœtum. Nor indeed is any strange thing added to it from the beginning to the end, except it be homogeneous, nor separated, if not heterogeneous: But every man ought to consider, before he begin any thing, how he may come to the knowledge of those Dragons that are to be joined to the chariot of Triptolemus, which are winged and volatile, which if you desire to know, you will find them in the Philosophical dung: for they are dung, and are generated from dung, and are that vessel, which Mary says, is not negromantical, but the regiment of your fire, without which you will effect nothing: I have revealed to you the truth, which by incredible pains I acquired from the monuments of the Ancients, not without the expense of many years . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem36.html","doctitle":"Emblem 36","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXVI. in 7. infrà.

Secundò, quod in terris, montibus, aëre flumine reperiatur. Utri igitur viae insistendum, an huic, an illi? U-trique, ut opinor, sed suo respectu; licèt haec nobis magis arrideat securior videatur. In terras projectus dicitur, quia elementum terrae primò apparet in obscuro nigro corpore. Deinde, quia vilis, parvi precii res sit, quae in viis peregrinantium in ipso fimo calcatur. Unde Rosarius, si vero, inquit, nomine nuncuparem, insipientes eum esse non crederent. Et Morienus Calidi quaerenti, an multùm de eo inveniatur, respondet: Non est hoc nisi, sicut sapiens dicit, ad divitem scilicet pauperem, ad largum ad avarum, euntem quoque sedentem.

Et Arnoldus asserit, quod lapis gratis haberi possit, in tanta copia, qua quis velit, nec interrogandus quispiam sit eam ob causam. Quae omnia vera sunt. Quis enim, nisi inhumanus, petenti aquam terrãterram denegabit? Cymbri antiquissimi à Romanis cùm eadem munera petiissent, nec obtinere possent, effusis copiis Italiam ingressi multa millia Romanorum cum Consulibus suis trucidârunt, ut historięhistoriae te-stantur. Terra enim, ut mater omnium preciosissima est, ut materia putrefactorũputrefactorum ultima, vilissima; Nil vilius luto aut coeno, quod tamen nihil aliud est, quàm terra aquae mixta. Quid gleba terrae commu-nis? Attamen Euripylus Neptuni filius eam Heroibus Argonautis pro xenio obtulit, ex quâ non recusatâ, sed grato animo acceptâ, post dissoluta in aqua Medea multa vaticinata est. Oportet enim terrâterram in aqua dissolvi, aliàs nec haec, nec illa quicquam valet: Hoc modo lapis projicitur in terras, in quibus tamen abjectus non permanet, 155 DiscUrsUs XXXVI. sed exaltatur ad montes, utpote Athum, Vesuvium, Aethnam, his similes flammivomos, quales in diversis orbis partibus permulti visuntur. In his enim ignis perpetuus ardet, qui lapidem sublimat, ad summam dignitatem evehit. In montibus, ut crescit, in rudi for-ma ex sulfure argento vivo, sic in montium vertice maturatur perficitur, ubi provenit herba, sine qua ignis temperari nequit; quia hac frigidâ humidâ in ignem conjectâ ejus vehementia re-tunditur per sui contrarium: A montibus ad aërem transit, ubi ha-bitationem invenit. Aër enim ipsi domus fit, quâ circumdatur, quod nihil aliud est, quàm quod portetur in ventre venti, nascatur in aëre, de quibus terminis antea dictum est. Tandem in fluviis pascitur, hoc est, in aquis, Mercurius: Inde in ejus honorem Athenienses hydro-phoria agebant, quia materia Philosophorum lapidis est aqua, ut Rosarius inquit, intelligitur de aqua illorum trium. Quam ob cau-sam Mercurius triceps quoque dicebatur, utpote marinus, coelestis terrestris, quia aquae, terrae aëri adesset. A Vulcano educatus traditur, furacitate insignis, quia Mercurius igni assuefieri docetur, qui volatilis est, secum aufert id, cui miscetur.

The Stone, as refuse, is by some supposed Thrown upon the earth, to rich and poor disclosed: Some say it is on the highest mountains placed Some say in the air, in water some at last; What they all say is true, but I'd have you That noble prize in mountains to pursue.","discourse-en":"Discourse 36. All men, that have but once heard the name and power of the Stone, unless they be such as are altogether incredulous, do commonly ask where it is to be found, that they may run as it were by a straight line to it? The Philosophers answer in two places: first, that Adam brought it with him out of Paradise, that it is in you, in me, and in every man, that birds flying carry it with them out of far countries: Secondly that it may be found in the earth, mountains, air, and water. Which therefore must we adhere to, whether to this, or that? To both, in my opinion, but in a peculiar respect, though the last is more plausible, and seems to us more safe. It is said to be throwne upon the earth, because the Element of earth does first appear in a dark and black body: Secondly, because it is a thing of mean and small esteem, which is trodden upon in the ways of travellers, and in dung itself; Whereupon says Rosarius, if I should name it, fools would not believe that to be it: And Calis sifting Morienus, and trying to get much out of him, he answers him thus: This, as a wise man says, has both the rich and the poor, both the liberal and the covetous, going also and sitting. For it is thrown in the ways, and trampled upon in dunghills, and many men have already digged in dunghills for it, and herein have been deceived. Mundus also in Turba says, if the Sellers knew it, they would not sell it at so mean a rate. And Arnold affirms, that the stone may be had gratis, as much as a man will, and for that reason no man ought to be interrogated. All which things are true. For who, but an inhuman wretch, will deny water and earth to him that desires it? The most ancient Cimbri having desired and not able to obtain the same gifts from the Romans, entering Italy with a great army slew many thousands of the Romans with their Consuls, as histories declare. For earth, as the mother of all things, is most precious, as the last matter of things putrified, most despicable; No thing more vile than clay or dirt, which notwithstanding is nothing else, but earth mixed with water. What more common than a clod of earth? Yet Euripylus the Son of Neptune offered it as a present to the heroic Argonauts, by which not refused, but thankfully accepted, afterwards being dissolved in water Medea divined many things. For earth must be dissolvd in water, otherwise neither this, nor that avails any thing: After this manner is the Stone cast upon the earth, in which notwithstanding it does not continue abject and contemptible, but is exalted to the mountains, as the flammivomous Athos, Vesuvius, Aetna, and the like, whereof many such are seen in diverse parts of the world: For a perpetual fire burns in them, which sublimes the Stone, and raises it to the highest dignity. As in 115 mountains it grows in a rude form out of Sulphur and Argent vive, so is it matured and perfected at the top of the mountains, where also is an herb produced, without which fire cannot be regulated, because being cold and moist if it be cast into fire, the vehemency of it is retunded by its contrary: From the mountains it passes to the air, where it finds habitation. For the air becomes a house to it, wherein it is enclosed, which is nothing else, but to be carried in the belly of wind, and born in the air, of which terms we have spoken before. At length it is nourished in rivers, that is, Mercury in waters: For that reason the Athenians in honor thereof instituted their Hydrophories, because the matter of the Philosophers stone is water, as Rosarius says, and is understood of the water of those three. For which reason Mercury was also said to have three heads, as being marine, celestial, and terrestrial, because he resided in the water, earth, and air. He is reported to be educated by Vulcan, notorious for thievery, because Mercury is said to be inured to fire, which is volatile, and carries away with it that wherewith it is mixed: Mercury in the days of old gave laws and discipline to the Egyptians, yea religion also to the Theban Priests, and to a great part of the world, because the Egyptians received polity, and sacred things from Chymical institutions, from them the Greeks, from them the Romans, from those many other nations, as has been elsewhere more at large demonstrated. Argus he slew with a stone, and converted Baltus into a Touchstone called Index. What need many words? All the volumes of the Chymists do inculcate nothing else but Mercury, and sufficiently confirm his power in this one versicle; What wise men seek in Hermes is contained. He therefore must be sought, till he be found, whether his harbor be in the air, fire, water, or earth. For he is in perpetual motion, running sometimes here sometimes there for the service of the Chymical Gods, as their footman, which his office is denoted, some men ascribing to him a daughter named Angelia . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem37.html","doctitle":"Emblem 37","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXVII. in 8. suprà.

As three essential things, which are the foundation, walls, and roof, are required to the building of every edifice, whereof one being absent, there can be no perfection of it, so are so many desired in order to complete the Philosophers compound, which are here named by their proper names: The author of Aurora, chapt. 20. speaking of the Separation of the Elements, Says, Earth is left in the same place, that the other three Elements may be radicated in it; if it were not for that, the Elements could have no foundation to build upon it a new jewel house: This foundation is here called Aqua fœtida, which is the mother of all the Elements, witness Rosarius, from which, and by which, and with which the Philosophers do prepare it, that is, the Elixir in the beginning, and the end: It is called Aqua fœtida, because it sends forth a Sulphureous stink, and the smell of Sepulchers: This is that water, which Pegasus struck out of Parnassus with his hoof, which Nonacris a mountain of Arcadia produces springing out of a rock at the top, which can only be contained in the hoof of a horse by reason of its most excessive strength: This is that Dragons water, as Rosarius calls it, which ought to be made by an Alembic, without adding any other thing, in the making of which there is an extraordinary stink: Which words some having heard betook themselves to distill the dung of men or other animals, in which operation they did indeed feel a most vehement stink, but found dung in the dung: But think not the Philosophers to be Beetles, which operate in dung, you must know that the stink, if there be any, is presently changed into great fragrancy, as Lully asserts of his Quintessence, to which he ascribes such a sweetness of savor, if it be rightly made, that being placed at the top of a house, it allures birds flying to it, and causes them to stand: But he puts his Quintessence in dung, by the most temperate heat of which that fragrancy follows, which some men having tried with strong wine, but in vain, did therefore accuse Lully of vanity, whereas themselves ought rather to be reproved of folly, who never tasted Lully's wine; but that golden Poet better understood Lully, who in his first book of Aurifaction thus sings: At non ille quidem sensit, quæ dicere prima Est facie visus, neꝗ tum stillantia vina Miscebat, etc. He thought not what at first he seemed to say, Nor then mixed stilling wines, etc. After Aqua fœtida comes the green Lion: concerning which says Rosarius; you have sought for greenness, supposing, that brass was a leprous body, because of that greenness which it has: and therefore I declare to you, that whatsoever is perfect in brass, is that greenness 118 alone, which is in it: because that greenness is by our Magistery suddenly turned into our most true gold, and this we have had experience of: yet you can no way prepare the Stone without Duenech green and liquid, which is seen to spring in our Mines: O blessed greenness, which does generate all things: From whence you must know, that no vegetable, and no fruit appears to germinate without a green color: in like manner you must know, that the generation of this thing is green, wherefore the Philosophers call it the bud. These are the words of Rosarius: This is the Philosophers gold, and brass, and Stone noted in the Chapters, a fume, vapor and water, the Spittle of Luna, which is joined to the light of Sol; This green Lion fights with the Dragon, but is by him overcome, and in length of time devoured; and the Lion being putrefied sweetness is expected to proceed from his mouth, as being Slain by Sampson: The Dragon getting the upper hand so fills himself with the Lions flesh, as to burst a little and die: Of which, the fat alone of a Lion curing quotidian Fevers, and grace and favor being obtained between Kings and people anointed therewith, a most excellent medicine may be made, very commodious for many maladies. In the third place follows the white fume, which, if it be coagulated, becomes water, and performs the office of water in washing, dissolving, and taking away spots like Soap: This is that fire against nature, which see that you find, so called, because it is contrary to nature undoing and destroying that, which She with diligent care compounded: This fire is not kindled as the Spirit of wind or oil, but as an incombustible matter, of equal duration and heat, and is a fire without light and combustion of great virtue and efficacy, which to find in darkness is a thing of no little difficulty, because it shines not, but of much greater to apply rightly to the work; the circumstances and properties of which we have sufficiently in several places described . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem38.html","doctitle":"Emblem 38","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXVIII. in 7. suprà.

Socrates being demanded what Country man he was, answered a Citizen of the world: by which his intention was to signify, that though he was born at Athens as to person, yet in mind he freely beheld the whole world, as his Country, and the things therein contained, the whole earth being a wise mans Country, where he lives well: So if any one ask the Philosophers what Countryman their Hermaphrodite is, they answer, he belongs to the world, or is in all corners of the world, where the Elements can be found, as the Son of the wise, who has a country common with them: But seeing that it happens not that any man is born twice or oftener, nor first enters this light in several but in one place, as Socrates is owned to be an Athenian, so is Rebis reputed an inhabiter of two mountains, that is, Mercury and Venus, from whence also the name of Hermaphrodite given him by both parents; a noble and large country is indeed no small help to do things excellently well, in which Citizens are preferred before foreigners, and promoted to public offices, that they may not lie in obscurity (as it happens in a mean place, and so something of light come to them from the country) but Show themselves rather with their own virtues, even in the small affairs of a house, and give light themselves to their own country: After this manner these mountains unknown to many men do acquire fame from the Hermaphrodite by reason of his illustrious actions, and name famous throughout the whole world. For who though never so little versed in the Philosophers books has not known Rebis? Who has not seen or beheld Androgynous with two heads? He verily has been known to the Indies themselves, and his fame has been dispersed farther, than the fame even of King Alexander: Many men do travel out of far countries to see and discourse some learned man, or otherwise remarkable for singular military industry, art or science, but many more will betake themselves to the said Mountains of Rebis, provided they can learn where they may be found: With how great study and care did Morienus being departed from Rome seek and at length find Adferus Alexandrinus, he himself declares in his book, and therefore was to be esteemed more happy, and acceptable to God, in that he had from a living teacher, and not from dumb masters learnt, and beheld this thing, that is, the native place of Rebis; no less assiduity and diligence ought they to use, who seek the country of Rebis by themselves, being informed by reason, and the documents of books: But though some books may sometimes seem to be clear and conspi 121cuous, yet they are so veiled and clouded with intricacy and obscurity, that by reason thereof it is very difficult to make distinction: Wherefore we must cautiously proceed with them, that they, which are prepared for remedy, may not be usd for poison: They are certainly a vast ocean, in which expert mariners sailing may by Astronomical instruments know the latitude, or elevation of the Equator above the Horizon, the Magnet Showing the North pole, but by no means the longitude, or how great an internal of degrees they are distant from the first Meridian, which is next to the fortunate Islands; so that they are uncertain in what place they may be between west and east: What therefore is here to be done? That which the same Mariners use to do, consult experience with reason, and thereby learn how to determine a long voyage by particular signs, promontories, Islands, and other things, that they may not for want of consideration fall upon Sands and rocks: But here is less danger, if the thing prosper not, but if so, greater gain, than there, where goods and life are lost in an hour: But the mountain of the Philosophical Mercury is not Nonacris, nor Atlas, where sometimes it is reported to be brought forth, but Parnassus with two tops, in one of which Hermes, in the other Venus resides: Here also is Apollo with the Muses, and Hippocrene, the fountain of Pegasus, with laurel always green: it is one mountain by name, but really two, as Hermaphroditus is beheld with two heads, and two members in one body: But what man of a thousand persists in ascending to the top of this mountain? Who dos not begin to hesitate at the bottom being impeded by I know not what obstacles? Whoever attaines to the middle of it? for Non levis ascensus, si quis petat ardua, sudor Plurimus hunc tollit, nocturnæ insomnis olivæ Immoritur, delet, quod mox laudaverat in se, Qui cupit æternæ donari frondis honore. Wherefore it is no strange thing, if only one of ten thousand undertake these Herculean labors, so as to set foot on the top of the mountain, and enjoy the immortal reward of a laurel garland, which that all those that are upright, docible, and addicted to virtue and learning may receive with joy, but the vain and envious deprived thereof, is much to be desired . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem39.html","doctitle":"Emblem 39","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XXXIX. in 3. seu 10. suprà.

Bacasser a Philosopher in Turba says, that which you seek for is of no small value, for you seek the greatest treasure, and most excellent gift of God. And learn, O yee students, that which the Philosophers have long since intimated, saying, The truth is not discerned but by error, and nothing begets more grief to the heart, than error in this art and work: For when a man thinks he has done, has a world, he will find nothing in his hands. These same things the ancient Philosophers were pleased to signify, propounding a Sphinx as if she denoted the obscurity and meanders of art. For this reason the Egyptians, in their sacred Isiaci, which were celebrated in honor of Osiris, by mitred Priests, with heads shaven, and all parts of the body clothed with a white linen garment down to the ankles, that they might not be known or discovered to the common people, erected a Statue of Silence, which was called Sigalion, in the entrance of the altar, the assistants being enjoined to keep silence, and turn their eyes to that image, and for the same cause they added the effigies of Sphinxes at the corners of the altar, which did represent the mystical knowledge of sacred things; as Boissardus does fromBoissardus? ancient Authors demonstrate: For Sphinx is a certain kind of monster most obscure to the Thebans, propounding riddles, nor only to them, but as before to the Egyptians, so after all others to those that aspire to art, and watches in the Philosophers books as before the gates of Thebes; if any man can pass by the monster, he suffers no evil by him, but he that through presumption of mind or wit endeavors to resolve his riddles, and cannot perform, acquires his own destruction, that is, grief to the heart, and damage to his affairs by error in this work. He that refers such allegories to history, has a mushroom for a head, and a Melon for a heart, as the Comedian says, and knows no more than that he deviates from the right way. Those things are too childish, and fit for old wives, if they be taken literally, otherwise the signs and tokens of profound learning. Monstrous wild beasts are indeed said to be in Africa by the name of Sphinxes, but here we discourse not of them, though the original and denomination of this fiction seems to be derived from them. The Philosophers Sphinx understands and uses human speech, namely Greek, as also propounds Subtle sentences and enigmatical questions, in which appears a singular Sharpness of understanding and learning, not so obvious to all other men, from which brutes are exceeding distant. He that is conversant in the Philosophers assertions will easily know them to be such: For where one thing is said, and another thing signified, there equivocation begets error, which is not only permitted, but also enjoined 124 to the Philosophers alone: The City of Thebes therefore being long perplexed with the riddles of Sphinx at length came one Oedipus, who gave such responses to the questions offered, that Sphinx could not forbear throwing herself downe from a rock. But who is this Oedipus? The Son of the King of Thebes, who being born, it being predicted to his father by an oracle, that he should be Slain by his Son, he commanded Oedipus to be killed, who being hanged upon a tree and left with a rope fastened cross his feet, was released by another countryman, and brought up; He coming to mans estate had indeed swelled feet, but sufficiently declared a quick wit above all men in unriddling this enigma propounded by Sphinx. But Sphinx is reported to have had many riddles, though this the chief, offered to Oedipus. What is that which in the morning goes upon four feet, at noon upon two, in the evening upon three? what was answered by Oedipus is not known; but some interpret it to the age of man, who are deceived: For a Quadrangle or the four Elements of all things are first to be considered, from hence we come to the hemisphere having two lines one straight the other crooked, that is, white Luna, from hence to a Triangle, which consists of body, Spirit, and Soul, or Sol, Luna, and Mercury: Hereupon says Rhasis in his Epistle. The Stone is a Triangle in being, a Quadrangle in quality. Hereto also relates the one and twentieth emblem, and the exposition thereof. Oedipus moreover is notorious for parricide and incest, which are two the most detestable vices, as can ever be thought of, but nevertheless they promoted him to a kingdom, otherwise due to him, he having unawares killed his father refusing to give way to him, and married the Queen, the wife of Laius, his own mother. But this written not to be imitated by any man as history, or example, it being only feigned and allegorically introduced by the Philosophers to discover the secrets of their doctrine. For in this work both happen; the first efficient, that is, the father, being killed and destroyed by his effect, that is, the Son, and afterwards the same effect joined the second efficient to himself, till she become one with him, and so the Son is coupled to his mother by matrimony, and enjoins his fathers kingdom, as it were by a triple right, of arms, wedlock, and succession. He has swelled feet, because he cannot run, and is as a bear, as he contains the greatest secret, or a toad, going with a slow pace; because it is fixed fixing another, and not avoiding or fearing fire, which though a medium of mean repute the Philosophers can by no means be without . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem40.html","doctitle":"Emblem 40","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XL. in 6. infrà.

The miracles of waters are so many and so great, as scarce to be comprehended in a large volume, concerning which several authors have here and there treated: But above all the two Philosophical waters are celebrated with that name, because they do as it were not only emulate, but also exceed the virtues and properties of all the rest. The rivers Sybaris, Axus of Macedonia, and Melas of Boeotia make Cattle black, if they drink thereof; but the rivers Crathis, Clitummus of Mevania, and Cephisus make black Cattle white. The waters of Sinuessa in the country of Campania takes away barrenness from both sexes. The river Afrodisius makes women barren: Cabura a fountain of Mesopotamia has water of a sweet smell; The water of Anyger in Peloponnesus stinks very much: The fountain of Jupiter Hammon is cold in the day time, hot by night, and morning and evening luke=warm by turns. We need not insist upon others, all things even contrary one to the other are performed by the Philosophers waters. Of which Says Lully in his book of the Quintessence, distin: 3. of inceration; And so there is a twofold consideration in the art, that is, of the single nature of one metal to make two contrary liquors in the composition; one, which has a fixing, congealing, and hardening virtue, and the other, which is volatile, unfixed, and soft. But that second liquor is hardened, fixed, and congealed by the first: from both which liquors results one stone congealed, fixed, and hardened, which has the virtue of congealing not a thing congealed, to harden a thing mollified, and to mollify a hard thing: From which it is evident, what those two waters are, and why to be reduced into one water: For the Stone is called water, because fusible, and on the contrary, water stone, because frangible: But these waters are drawn out of different places, sometimes in a long tract, as may be seen at Rome s about Aqua Virginis, and other artificial fountains, and then they must be mixed by conflux, that one may be made of two. For if one be of a hot and the other of a cold virtue, being mixed together they will acquire mixed virtues, and after a wonderful manner regulate one the other: From hence are most excellent medicinal and bath waters to be produced, which will profligate all sorts of diseases and maladies, and restore a man to firm health. Nature does indeed by her occult artifice of composition confound and mix many waters in the bowels of the earth with several virtues of Mines, which are wholesome and commodious to many sick and infirm persons, but if art be added with due regiment, all evacuations being premised and other things to be pretermitted, and mix those things that are to be mixed together, that composition will be far more effectual: Which, though it seem artificial, is notwithstanding merely natural, because of things different it is made one simple homogeneous matter, 127 which can never be effected by art: A mixtion and confusion is indeed caused by art, without the help of nature no true and natural union, which is made by nature alone: There is an artificial mixtion of various simples in Triacle, which is performed by contrition and fermentation, but no man will (except inconsiderately) affirm it to be a natural composition, much less a homogeneous medicament: As to the artificial mixtion of substances it is manifest, that they do not enter one into the other in the least parts, though they cannot again be divided and separated one from the other by the industry of man. But as to the mixtion of all qualities we must enquire, whether the first Triacles of all Simples may be reduced not one Quintessence, or yet in their powders or substances be, as before, as accidents in a subject, or color in a wall; and then what is to be said of the second, third, and fourth qualities? Probable it is that all the qualities are yet inherent in their own subjects, and not compounded together by a true natural mixtion; otherwise, if the qualities should relinquish their bodies, there would be four Quintessences in every 2composition 1artificial, according to the number of the order of the qualities, first, second etc. without their bodies, and separable; which they say is not so with the coagulum of a hare, which being in flux by the tenuity of the blood stops and as it were coagulates it, but in the coagulation and concretion cuts and resolves the same; soe the operations of vinegar, lead, and many other things are contrary according to the different use of them, because nature has soe wonderfully mixed them: So also has the Philosophical water different and contrary virtues, because nature has by the help of art mixed it with things contrary into one indivisible substance, which is nothing else but a Quintessence, in respect of other things to be mixed with it . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem41.html","doctitle":"Emblem 41","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLI. in 3. infrà. retrograda existente simplici seu Basi.

How improperly some of the Mythologists resolve the Allegory of Adonis, and ascribe him sometimes to the Sun, the Boar, by which he was slain, to a hard winter, sometimes to the seed of wheat, which is six months with Proserpina under the earth, and as many above the earth with Venus, is elsewhere sufficiently explained and refuted by us. Here we do with the consent of all men declare the Philosophical Sun to be meant by Adonis: From whence the Versicle: Omnia sunt idem, Dionysus, Sol, et Adonis: And Orpheus:------Qui vario lætaris nomine Adoni, Germinum et idem author, pariter puer atꝗ puella. All which are by no means to be understood of the celestial, but Philosophical Sun; for this expresses both sexes, that not: So also they attribute the very same thing to Dionysus, and the Sun, as to Adonis, and on the contrary, as also to Osiris. Adonis is killed by a Boar, that is, by Acetum acerrimum, or the solutive water, which has terrible teeth like a boar, with which he tushes Adonis; because the Philosophical Sol is mortals wounded by that boar, loosened in the members and cut off; But Venus endeavors to help her Paramour, who being dead, she laid him amongst Lettuces, and watched him. After the same manner is Osiris killed by Typhon, and cut into several pieces, which Isis, the wife of Osiris, gathered up, and being joined together buried. The same mourning, which followed the death of Osiris every year in Egypt, was also celebrated after the death of Adonis in Syria and the bordering kingdoms; where for some days weeping and wailing being heard, afterwards were signs of joy given, and dancing, as if he, that was dead, now lived anew being conveyed to heaven: From whence arose the vanity of their religion or heathenish superstition, which grew to an excessive height, the Devil giving occasion, and procuring false miracles. Adonis was (as they feign) born of Cinyre King of Cyprus, and Myrrha his daughter, he is said to be born in incest (if history be considered) wicked, if an allegory, not unlawful, but principally necessary: For if the mother and Son, or the father and daughter be not joined together, and an offspring produced from thence, nothing is perfected in this art. For here, the nearer the man and wife are one to the other in blood, in the first degree of consanguinity, or second, the more fruitful they are, and on the contrary, the more remote, the more unfruitful, which is not tolerable in the matrimony of men. For this cause Oedipus married his own mother, Jupiter his Sister, so also Osiris, Saturn, Sol, the red servant, Gabritius; Sol (in a Metaphor of Belinus in the Rosary) 130 speaks thus of Adonis, that is, of himself: Know yee, that my father Sol has given me power above all power, and clothed me with the garment of glory: And a little after: For I am his only Son and more like my father, etc. I divest my servants of their power and nature, and cloth them with my beautiful splendor and light (which my father gave me) in all their works: For I am excellent, who do exalt and depress all things, and none of my servants is above me, but one, who is permitted to be repugnant and contrary to me: And he destroys me, yet destroys not my nature: And he is Saturn, who separates all my parts: Afterwards I go to my mother, who gathers together all my divided and separated members: I illuminate all those things that appertain to me, and cause light to appear openly in the way from my father Saturn, as also from my mother, who is an enemy to me. The words hitherto spoken are so clear, as to discuss darkness from the eyes of the mind even to him that is but meanly conversant in the reading of authors, and discover the light of the Sun, which is abundantly perspicuous in the coherencies insinuated of things and persons: For those things which are true, though shaded under the veil of an allegory, do consent in wonderful harmony one with another, but those things which are false are repugnant, and inconsistent with themselves, and others . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem42.html","doctitle":"Emblem 42","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLII. in 4. supra.

Of the Secrets of Nature. Nature, Reason, Experience, and reading must be the guide, staff, Spectacles, and Lamp to him that is employed in Chymical affairs.","epigram-en":"Epigram 42. Pursuing art, let Nature be your guide, Tracing her steps your feet will not back=slide: Let reason be your staff, experience add Strength to your sight, discerning good from bad: In darkness reading will as light direct, That ambiguities you may detect.","discourse-en":"Discourse 42. The chances, which may happen to travelers, are innumerable, especially if they take a journey on foot by night through slippery and dangerous places; to which four things are requisite as chiefly necessary, not to speak of the victuals provided, and a strong body: In the first place, a companion or guide not ignorant of the ways, through which he must pass: For if one ignorant man guide another, the same thing happens to them as to blind men, if they do not both fall headlong into a ditch, yet into errors and mistakes: Secondly, a Staff, by which the slipperiness and peril of the way, lest it be detrimental to a man, may be avoided: Thirdly, sound eyes, for such journeys are most dangerous to the blind or dim sighted: Fourthly, a lamp or lighted torch, that the diversities and differences of the ways may be discerned. After the same manner if a man expose himself to a most difficult journey in pursuit of the Philosophic medicine, he will, besides charge and strength of body, desire four things exactly parallel and correspondent to those aforesaid, to wit, Nature, Reason, experience, and reading: whereof if any one be wanting, the rest will do little or no good at all: For by these, as by four wheels, the Philosophic chariot moves, to which one of the wheels cannot be wanting, if it be left, it avails nothing. Nature presupposes natural bodies and Spirits, as subjects first ministered by nature, upon which art must afterwards act, preparing, purifying, and fitting it, that thereof may be made that, which art promises for the end: So a Potter takes water and earth, a Glassemaker ashes and Sand, a Smith iron, copper, tin, lead, Silver or gold, a Tanner raw hides, and so other men other things: Such respect also has the operator of Chymistry to his materials: Their materials are to them very well known even the first day, he, when he begins, continues for the most part ignorant of his for many years, I will not say, during his whole life. Nature does indeed point at the matters, but there are many things, which obscure the impression of nature, that it cannot be known. The first intention therefore is, seriously to contemplate how nature proceeds in her operations to the end that the natural subjects of Chymistry may without defect or superfluity be had: Wherefore Nature must be the guide and companion of so great a journey, whose footsteps must be traced. Secondly, reason must be as a staff to keep the steps and feet steady and firm, that they may not slip or waver, For without the exercise of reason a man will be apt to fall 133 into errors, and therefore say the Philosophers; Whatsoever you hear, consult with reason, whether it can be so, or no: For no man is forced to believe or perform things impossible, except he be of weak memory, dull genius, and foolish imagination to impose upon himself accepting things false for true, and rejecting true for false: They say also that they care not for words, whatsoever may be spoken, but only for things, what may be understood; And that words are for things, and not things for words: As for example, Suppose a man say that glass is made malleable by the Philosophical tincture; Why Shall not I believe it, if provided reason dictates it? Thirdly, Experience will be as Spectacles, by which things may be seen at a distance; These are optic instruments, invented and made by art, to help and amend the weakness of mens eyes. Much like to these are experiments about the mineral matter of every kind tried, seen or truly heard, which the more they are in memory, the more will a man of reason draw from thence, and compare them among and with other things, that he may perceive, what is true, what not. Fourthly, Reading does as it were kindle a clear lamp in the understanding, without which there will be every where darkness and thick clouds. But the reading of good authors ought to be often repeated, otherwise it will not be at all effectual. Hereupon Bacasser in Turba says: He therefore, that is of an even temper, and exercises patience without regret, will attain to this art as by a direct line, but he, that thinks himself able sooner to reap benefit from our books, is deceived, and it had been better not to have looked therein, than ever to have touched them: And so on . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem43.html","doctitle":"Emblem 43","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLIII. in 5. seu 12. infrà.

Of the Secrets of Nature. Give ear to the Vulture's words, which are nowise false.","epigram-en":"Epigram 43. The Vulture on the mountain stands in sight, Himself proclaiming daily, black, and white, Citrine, and red; nor false: The Raven is The same, which without wings by nature flies In dismal darkness, and in glorious light, For either will to the art conduct you right.","discourse-en":"Discourse 43. We daily in many places hear birds prattling or imitating the voice of man, such as Parrots, Ravens, Dawes, and Pies. So Pliny writes that, at the time wherein he published his history, Agrippina the wife of Claudius Caesar had a thrush, imitating the speech of men. The young Caesars had also a Starling and Nightingales accustomed to the Greek and Latin tongue, and daily speaking new things, with a long form of words also. But such birds now frequently happening they are thought less worthy of admiration, for all birds endued with a broad tongue may by use and custom be brought to speak and babble. But that Vulture, which the Philosophers make mention of, did not learn words, if any he utters, by use, but his nature tacitly expresses them. The Philosophers do indeed say, that he continually cries out, and with a loud Voice pronounces, who and what he is, wherein he imitates great Princes, who in the beginning of their intimations will always make their titles and inheritances known, not in token of any pride, but for other reasons, that they also themselves may know, what principalies they govern, or right of inheritance they pretend to: So it is very material to know, what colors, as ensigns of arms and titles, the Philosophical bird is adorned with, and wherein he excels all others. I, Says he, as Rosarius has it from Hermes, am the black of white, and the citrine of red, and certainly I speak truth and lie not. He affirms himself blacke, white, citrine, and red, and such he really is, for though he does not as yet actually possess the last colors, yet he expects the inheritance of them: Hereupon Says Rosinus in his book of divine interpretations; Take the Stone, which is black, white, red, citrine, that admirable bird, which flies without wings in the darkness of the night, and clearness of the day: For coloration arises from the bitterness which is in his throat, but mere water proceeds from his blood, as Alexander said. Take (My Son) the Stone of four colors. The Philosophers books do abundantly declare and insinuate that the Stone has all these colors, which are principal, in a successive order. But why the Philosophical subject is called a Vulture, there is reason to be alleged. Of Vultures the black are of most esteem, they are rapacious, but fly Slowly, because of the bigness of body. They say that this bird conceives without the seed of the males, and generates without coition, and that their offspring do arrive to a great age even to a hundred years. Their nests they build in high rocks, no man has attained to them. Two chickens are for the most part seen: They are helpful and commodious against Serpents. They are offended and 136 perplexed with the East wind. When they begin to lay eggs, they bring a thing out of the Indies, which is as a nut, having within a thing that may be moved, and forthwith yields a sound, which when they have applied to them, they produce many young chickens, but one only remains, which is called Immusulus. Hermodorus Fonticus in Caelius is a witness, that Vultures of all animals are the most innocent, because they do not at all meddle with any of those things which men sow, plant, and breed. Moreover they kill no animals. They also abstain from birds though dead by a certain instinct of affinity: For this cause they were best esteemed in divinations, as the originals of the City of Rome declare. The Philosophical bird expressing almost all these properties of Vultures, is therefore by Hermes and others not undeservedly called Vulture, which is also slow in flight, and black of color; It conceives by itself: For thus says Rosarius about the end; And it is the Dragon, which weds itself, and impregnates itself, and brings forth in its own season etc. And Rosinus to Sarratant: And that is the Serpent, administering pleasure to itself, impregnating itself, and bringing forth in one day, etc. It lives and endures a very long time, and multiplies itself. For that which Virgil writes of the bird called a Phoenix, is as proper to this, because it is the same. Alipedem Cervum Corvus ter vincit, at illum Multiplicat novies Phoenix reparabilis ales. Three ages of a Hart the Raven lives, Which the rare Phoenix nine times over survives. It is very difficult to climb this birds nest: It fights with the Mercurial serpent, and overcomes it, that is, Sol with Luna. It is conceived by the wind, and carried in its belly, and bred in the air. The Stone Ætites, containing a little stone sounding within it is by many men called Totium. One only Immusulus is found in the Philosophers nest. The Philosophic bird is also most innocent, because it hurts no body, it is beneficial to all that know it, and most excellent in divinations. But why does it make its nest on a Mountain, and sitting so cry out? Rosinus answers according to Rasis, who says Behold the most high mountains, which are both on the right and left, and climb up thither: There is our Stone found, and in another mountain, which produces all sorts of Painter colors, and Spirits or Species, there likewise it is: Morienus: Climb up the high mountains, planted wih trees, because there is our stone found, and hidden: And Hermes: Take yee the blessed Stone, break it to pieces, and wash the red stone, from which is extracted that which is found in mountains, and especially sometimes in old Sinks."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem44.html","doctitle":"Emblem 44","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLIV. in 5. seu 12. suprà.

The allegory of Osiris we have elsewhere (namely in the first book of Hieroglyphics) reduced to its true original, which is Chymical, and fully explained it: Wherefore here to repeat the same things (though the same things ought to be spoken of the same things) we judge superfluous: but nevertheless we will here form a parallel discourse, which will always be and remain within the prisons of that ancient Chemia, which is solely decanted and decipered by the Poets: Will you persuade me that Osiris was a God, or King of the Egyptians? I will not believe, though you persuade me to believe; For dogs (as it is in the Proverb) smell far otherwise, far otherwise Swine: I do plainly deny him to be a God, and you will ascent to me, unless you be a heathen, or of an opinion contradictory to right reason: And that he was no King, is demonstrated by all the circumstances which are elsewhere considered: The Sun he is, but Philosophical, the name of which being in many authors often attributed to it, the vulgar, who know no other light but that of the world, have interpreted for it. The Philosophers Sun has denomination from the Sun of the world, because it contains the properties of nature descending from that celestial Sun, or agreeable to it: Osiris therefore, Dionysus, Bacchus, Jupiter, Mars, Adonis, Oedipus, Perseus, Achilles, Triptolemus, Pelops, Hippomenes, and Pollux are the Sun: but Isis, Juno, Venus, the mother of Oedipus, Danaë, Deidamia, Atalanta, Helena, the Moon; as also Latona, Semele, Europa, Leda, Antiope Thalia. And these are the parts of the compound, which before operation is called Stone, and by the name of every metal, Magnesia: After operation, Orcus, Pyrrhus, Apollo, Aesculapius. The adjuncts are Typhon, Python, the Boar: The Artists are Hercules, Ulysses, Jason, Theseus, Pyrithous: The labors and perils, which were undergone by these artists, are innumerable: The labors of Hercules, the errors of Ulysses, the perils of Jason, the attempts of Theseus, and the remora's of Pyrithous may be seen: This is the great volume of matter and doctrine, through which in every page Vulcan, Mercury, and Saturn do run backwards and forwards, the first, as the father and cause of all, without which nothing is effected, the second, as the matter and form, the third, as the efficient. Sol takes his sister Luna to wife: Jupiter Juno, as Saturn Rhea, and Osiris Isis: Dionysus is ripped out of his mother Semele being burnt by the lightning of Jove to be matured in the thigh of Jupiter his father, Aesculapius out of Coronis his Mother: Dionysus coming to maturity shows men a new way of drinking wine, undertaking an expedition even to the Indies; Osiris and Triptolemus, the sowing and use of fruit, Aesculapius, the administration of Me 139dicine: Dionysus so called by the Greeks, is Bacchus with the Romans, with the Egyptians Osiris, with the Syrians Adonis. Oedipus killed his father and married his mother; Perseus slew his Grandfather, Typhon his brother Osiris, a Boar Adonis, Ceres the nurse of Triptolemus his father Eleusius; Hippomenes overcame Atalanta by a golden apple. Tantalus the father of Pelops obtained Hippodamia by the dispute of a Chariot. Osiris was cut in pieces, and joined together again by Isis his mother, sister, and wife. The child Pelops was boiled and dressed, and his shoulder eaten by Ceres, and again restored to life, an ivory shoulder being added: Achilles and Triptolemus were put under coals of fire by night, and in the day time nourished with milk, Triptolemus by Ceres his Nurse, Achilles by his mother Thetis: Achilles and Helena were the causes of the Trojan war, 1Achilles, 5as 6impulsive, 4Helena, 2as 3efficient; Helena was hatched of an egg, and at the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, from whom Achilles descended, the apple of Eris, the first cause of the rape of Helena, was thrown about. Pollux was with the Argonauts, who (if they lived) are presupposed to have lived near fifty years before the beginning of the Trojan war, and Helena with Pollux came both out of one egg; Helena therefore was an old woman when she was ravished by Paris: Medea was married to Achilles in the Elysian fields, then an old toothless woman: unless perhaps She restored youth to herself, as She did to Aeson, the father of Jason, and as Ceres to Pelops, for which reason he is said to become twice young: Perseus received a flying horse from Pallas, and in recompence brought her the head of Medusa, to whom Mercury gave a Scimitar, and other Gods other weapons; Ceres gave Triptolemus a chariot with flying Dragons: When Pallas was born of Jupiters brain, as also when Sol lay with Venus it rained gold at Rhodes; And Jupiter in the form of a golden shower had coition with Danae, as a Swan compressed Leda, as a Cuckoo his Sister Juno, as a Bull Europa, as a Satyr Antiope, and so there is coherence in all . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem45.html","doctitle":"Emblem 45","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLV. in 3. suprà. vertendo Bas.sum et incip.e ab initio in clave d.

As in a round or Spherical Palace, a fire kindled in one place illustrates the parts above and below round about all the walls, except those, where a table or the like standing in the middle may by its objection and interposition impede, and admit a dark shadow; So also the Sun being placed in that great Palace or carved theater of the heaven does by its rays illuminate every concavity of heaven, the bodies contained therein which are diaphanous and receptive of light, that is, all stars whatsoever both erratic and fixed, except where the density of the earth in the middle may prohibit: For there a black and dark shadow, which is called night, continues so long, till it be driven away by the presence of the Sun, and light established and made conspicuous in stead thereof: A shadow therefore and night is the privation or absence (as day on the contrary is the irradiation and circumfusion) of the Solar light. A shadow is that which cannot endure the aspect of the Sun, and therefore avoids and absconds itself sometimes in this sometimes in that part of the earth, as the Sun is in opposition. The Sun and shadow never saw themselves together, though, if nature would admit, they might in every moment, but the Sun considering her as an enemy to himself, always pursues her flying, and can never take her weary, as Buchanan Buchanan? in his book of Spheres ingeniously has declared: For imitation and example of that great Sun, and shadow thereof, the Philosophers have observed that their Sun has also a black, cloudy, and flying Shadow: Hereupon Says Hermes, My Son! take from the ray its shadow, that is, see that you bring your Sun round about the primum mobile, of which Vulcan is made overseer, that even that part of your Earth, which is now covered with a shady night, may obtain the clear light of the Sun: for if the whole Firmament of the heaven with all things contained were not every natural day, that is, in twenty four hours altogether circumvolved by the first motion, but the Sun only moved by its own (called the second and annual) motion, it would happen that they, which are Antipodes below us, would for the Space of almost six months have a night, and we a day, and afterwards on the contrary they a day and we a night; so that the whole year would consist of one night and day, as now these courses are by experience and reason confirmed to be most true under both the Poles: But it seemed far otherwise to divine providence, which therefore has ordained two motions of the Planets, the first and second, and so distributed the year into many days: Now that shadow and Sun do together make day and night, which the Sun by itself alone could not effect, whose property it is to illuminate all opposite places and bodies, but not make a shadow, except accidentally by his absence: So also the Philosophical Sun does with its shadow make a day, that is, light and night or darkness, namely Latona or Magnesia, whose Shadow Democritus teaches, as appears in the third book of his 142 Golden table at the beginning, must be extinguished and consumed by a fiery medicine. The utility of shadows in Astronomical affairs is so great, that without them that Science can scarce be perfected; Chymists do also ascribe it to their shadows, that their art comes to perfection; for what is this Sun without a shadow? As a clapper without a bell: That indeed makes the first motion to a sound, but this gives the sound; that is the quill, this the instrument; that the tongue, this the great mouth: A shadow is a most contemptible thing, not next to a Being, so also the Philosophers shadow is a thing black blacker than black, as they term it, or of less esteem than weeds, not in respect of itself, but the opinion of men and plenty; What more commodious than fire, what more precious than water, what more amiable than earth, which yields flowers and all amiable things, what more pleasant than air, which being restrained and obstructed, all things cease to be pleasant? Yet nevertheless, because they are exposed to mens uses in their large Spheres, they are esteemed most vile, by a preposterous imagination: So also is both the common and Philosophical shadow undervalued; They that live long in subterranean shadows, if brought suddenly to the clear light of the Sun, do lose their eyesight; So they that reside and operate in the Philosophical shadow alone, and do not join the Sun with it, are deprived of judgment and the sight of the mind, and frustrated of the effect: The celestial Sun being elevated upon the South there is greater heat and less shadow; so also here heat being increased the shadow is diminished, and on the contrary; We must therefore begin the Sun being from the meridional side bending itself again to the top of our head, in Capricorn; and the first operation will be even finished at Aries, then begins the womens work, even to Leo; and afterwards labor proceeds from labor, till the year take the tail with the head, as a Snake, that is to say, is completed . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem46.html","doctitle":"Emblem 46","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLVI.

Cùm itaque concursus fiere ex omnibus Europae, Asiaeq́ue partibus ad oracu-lum Delphicum, poëtae eum locum, nẽpenempe Parnassum esse in medio terrae fabulati sunt; idq́idque ad exemplo Jovis probarunt, qui duabduabus aɋ-lisaqui-lis emissis id experimentatus fuerat: Verùm cùm haec res historiae fi-de non nitatur, non à veritate alienum est, eam chymicis asscribere, praesertim cùm totus Apollo, ut dictum, sit chymicus origine, licet daemon postea hominum suꝑstitionemsuperstitionem sub eo nomine confirmârit vaticinia dederit.

Great Jove two Eagles out of Delphi sent To the East and Western parts, for this intent, That he the middle of the earth might find; Which, there returning, well resolved his mind. But those two Eagles are two stones, which have One from the East, the other from the West.","discourse-en":"Discourse 46. Cicero in his book of the nature of the Gods declares the most ancient Apollo to be the Son of Vulcan, and keeper of Athens: Which opinion, if it be, as it ought, transferred to an Allegory, is indeed most true; because Vulcan produces the Philosophical Sol, which is Apollo. But it has prevailed, that he was born of Jupiter; and that Latona having two children in her womb, Apollo and Diana, which she conceived of Jupiter, Juno being jealous sent Python a Serpent of prodigious magnitude and malice, to persecute and perplex her being great with child. The miserable woman after tedious wanderings was at length brought by a Ship to the Island Ortygia, to her sister Asteries, who therein reigned: And that Island, being almost all overflowed with the Sea, gave place to Latona being in travail, whereupon it was called Delos, which before was Ἂδηλος: There therefore being in labor, first came forth Diana, and she did the office of a midwife to her mother laboring to bring forth her brother Apollo; From whence it came to pass that women going with Child did in the time of their labor invoke her deity, and called her either Lucina or Ilithya, because she showed light to infants born their eyes being opened: Apollo therefore being born and grown up slew Python the tormenter of his mother with arrows, and killed the Cyclopes because they made lightning for Jupiter to destroy his Son Aesculapius, whom Jupiter condemned to hell blasted with lightning, because he had restored Hippolytus to life being torn in pieces by horses. We have in many places demonstrated these things to be merely Chymical: For Latona, Cynthia, Apollo, and Python are requisites of the art, which have such a relation one to the other, as has been declared; but these things being divulged in the writings of the most ancient Poets, as Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus, Homer, etc. have given the ignorant occasion to ascribe religion and veneration to Apollo: Hereupon Apollo is in many places of Europe and Asia worshipped, and innumerable temples erected to him; And especially at Delphos he had a temple to be worshipped by ancient religion, wherein a great number of statues made of solid gold and silver or great weight and artifice was reposited by Kings and Princes, with other most precious gifts, which were hidden in sacred places for religion sake by men of all degrees. Pausanias reports that a brazen Skeleton of admirable artifice was hung at the top of the temple by Hippocrates. That famous Tripos was also consecrated to Apollo by Pelops, at the time when he married Hippodamia the daughter Oenomaus King of Elis, which Tripos Mulciber made, and gave to Pelops: It was erected in the middle of the temple, in which Pythia sitting 145 received the inspiration of the Devil gaping with a wide mouth, and then prophesied, and gave responses to those that desired to know the events of things to come: Delphos was indeed in Boeotica seated about the foot of Parnassus. Near to the temple was the divining fountain, named Cassiotis, which, if burning torches was brought to it, did extinguish them: if they were removed far off, they were suddenly kindled, and took fire; and the water of that fountain being drank yielded the virtue of divining, but notwithstanding the drinkers of that water were made of shorter life. Concourse therefore being made from all parts of Europe and Asia to the Delphic Oracle, the Poets feign that place, namely Parnassus to be in the middle of the earth, and that they proved by an example of Jupiter, who had experimented it by sending forth two Eagles: But this thing not being supported by the reputation of history, it is not derogatory from the truth, to ascribe it to Chymical matters, especially Apollo being, as has been declared, altogether Chymical by original, though the Devil afterwards confirmed the superstition of men, and gave prophesies under that name. The two Eagles are two stones, whereof one comes from the East, the other from the West, which the Philosophers have many ways demonstrated. Jupiter sends them forth, as his Ensign=bearers. The Eagle seems indeed a friend to Apollo or the Sun, in proving her chickens at the Sun, which if they cannot endure, She disowns them as illegitimate. Its feathers being joined with other things are said not to putrefy, and to devour the feathers of other birds, easily admitting gilding also: By old age, or sickness it dies not, but by famine; For the upper beak grows so crooked that it cannot receive food: Which having cast off it plunges itself three times in a fountain, and so is said to return to youth. Hereupon says the Psalmist: Your youth shall be renewed as the youth of an Eagle: This of all birds is never affected with Lightning: It wars with the dragon, which hunts after its eggs for the sake of them: All the endowments of whose nature have afforded the Philosophers reason to predicate the Eagle in their art, and assimilate the stone to it, whereof innumerable examples being obvious in their books, we will not here alleged more . . . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem47.html","doctitle":"Emblem 47","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLVII. in 8. duplici suprà.

From the East a Wolf, from the West a Dog appears, Which raging fall together by the ears, Choler inciting they each other tear, And gaping seem as if they rabid were: These are two stones, which you may soon acquire, For all men may obtain them at desire.","discourse-en":"Discourse 47. The Philosophers have in many places made mention of two stones given to us gratis, as Isaac, Arnold, and others, amongst whom Avicenne says they lie in dung neglected and rejected by the vulgar, which, if they be joined together, are able to complete the Magistery: Some men extol the occidental Mercury, which has preferred itself before gold, and overcome it: But the Author of the advice of the wedlock of Sol and Luna out of the epistle of Aristotle does best of all describe the two stones, where he says: That there are two principal stones of this art, the white and the red of wonderful nature: at the setting of the Sun the white begins to appear upon the surface of the waters, hiding itself till midnight, and afterwards declines to the bottom: But the red operates contrariwise, it beginning to ascend upon the waters at the rising of the Sun till noon, and then descends to the bottom. These Stones therefore are the aforesaid Eagles sent by Jupiter from Delphi; These also are the wolf and dog coming from different or opposite parts of the earth, which bit and werried one the other, and both became mad, as Rhasis in his epistle declares: These stones are the most true Bezoar, whereof the east Indies send the best, drawn from the bowels of wild beasts, the West Indies yield another but of less efficacy, had at Peruana out of animals made tame; So the East affords a most fierce wolf, the west a dog familiar to men, that is, Sulphur comes from the East, Mercury from the Western tract, whereof this is gentle and tractable, that choleric and angry; which two, when first they find one another, do fall together by the ears: and the dog being of notable bigness obtains the first victory, prostrating the wolf, and bringing him to deaths door: But the wolf recovering strength afterwards overthrows the dog, and being cast down never leaves him till he be utterly killed and dead; In the mean time receiving from the dog no less wounds nor less mortal, than he gave him, till they werry one another to death: As touching the wolf Says Rosinus to Euthicia: That he is a fortified soldier the conqueror of two, of much esteem and most intense strength, perforating bodies when he meets with them, and is white in apparition, red by experiment, and is the man which took Luna to wife, whom some men suppose to be gold of a most precious connection and composition, whose congealed part is never dissolved, nor footsteps or impressions defaced, which God has freely bestowed upon the pious and elect Philosophers: You must know, that nature has gotten an equal as an enemy. These are his words. And a little after he says: That Sulphur is most strong, and fighting against fire which it contains and is contained: for a most precious color proceeds from them being joined together, and that Sulphur, which is naturally volatile, can never afterwards fly away, because the Soul has 148 perforated it, in like manner the tincture of the Soul has both perforated and is mixed with the body, and the body has contained the soul, and restrained the natural part from flying. And then to one demanding which of the stones was strongest, he answers: That stone which is no stone is stronger than the other enemy: but the red is stronger than that which strengthened its companions by its fortitude. The Oriental wolf is therefore stronger than the Occidental dog, though he obtain not the victory effectually, but perishes together with the enemy: but the tinging poison is produced from both: The difference between a wolf and dog is small, a Mastiff or great dog representing the form and shape of a wolf, so as to seem a wolf originally, but made tame by long progeneration: After the same manner Sulphur and Mercury do little differ one from the other, because that proceeds from this, or this from that: Mercury did indeed beget Sulphur, but Sulphur purged Mercury and made it so: Concerning these the same Rosinus, the question being asked, from whence comes its color? answers, from the most intense bitterness of it: and again. From whence comes its bitterness and intension? he answers from the impurity of its metal: And again: Is its red color never supereminent? he answers, Yes: And again: Is it also never hotter than fire? he answers; Fire in respect of it is as water in respect of fire: And again: Is it not stronger than fire? he answers, not. And again: Why therefore do you affirm it to be stronger than fire? he answers, because fires meeting together do one destroy the other. It is therefore manifest that one becomes the food and aliment of the other, and so much as one decreases, so much the other increases, till that which increases prevails, and the Dragon devours the serpent: In great fights it often times happens, that they that undergo the greater slaughter do win the field and victory; So also though the dog lay prostrate, yet was not altogether overcome, he holding his enemy so fast, that he could not live without him, nor he die without the other . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem48.html","doctitle":"Emblem 48","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLVIII. in 5. seu 12. suprà. vertendo simplicem. ac initio.

Xerxes that most potent King of Persia leading his army through dry and rugged places in hot weather, being thirsty, refused not a draught of muddy water offered by a soldier, but drank most freely, and rewarded him that brought it very amply. And indeed if a man at this very time (as some of the latest historians affirm) travel through the borders of Persia, it is said that fountains of sweet water are very rarely found, standing waters being brackish, and the Soil itself in the surface yielding much saltness: After the same manner the King, which the Philosophers have made mention of being perplexed with thirst, commanded plenty of sweet water to be brought him, of which he drank his fill; as if manifest to any man by the Allegory of Merlinus. The cure of the sick and discolored King is undertaken by several Physicians: The Egyptians administering their medicines stirred the humors being yet crude, which Hippocrates affirms ought to be purged being first concocted, unless they be fluxible and uncertain: For then they must be forthwith expelled, that they may not peradventure make an assault upon the more noble parts or bowels. Hereupon dangerous Symptoms, such as Hipothymy and Syncope happened to the King, but the Physicians of Alexandria coming last of all, and esteemed more successful in a chronic disease, restored the King to his former health. It is well worth while to cure so great a King, who being made sound extends a liberal hand and a serene aspect to his Physician. We have read that many mens cures have been very nobly rewarded by several Kings, as that of Democides by Polycrates a tyrant of Samos with two talents, of Erasistratus (who, as Pliny writes, was Scholar of Chrysippus, begotten upon the daughter of Aristotle) for curing King Antiochus being sick for the love of his Stepmother Stratonice, with a hundred talents by his Son Ptolemy, of Jacob Cocterius, Physician of Louis II King of France, from whom he received four thousand Crowns every month as a stipend, and other later we make no mention of; but the cure of this King is recompensed with yet a far greater gratuity or reward. For thus say Hermes and Geber in the Rosary: He that has once completed this art, if he should live ten hundred thousand years, and every day feed four thousand men, would not want. This Senior confirms, saying: He that has that stone, whereof the Elixir is made is so rich, as he that has fire, can give fire, to whom he will, and when he will, and as much as he will without his own detriment or want. The father of Democritus was so rich, that he gave a feast to the army of Xerxes, and Pythius a man exceeding wealthy offered to the same pay for his whole army, and victual for five months, provided that the youngest of his five sons, which was the comfort of his old age, might be permitted to stay at home, and not be constrained to go 151 into the Kings army, but the barbarous King taking the petition of Pythius most unworthily, commanded his younger son to be cut in two pieces, and fastened to stakes on both sides the high way, by which his whole army was to pass, as Sabellicus observes in book 2. Ennead 3. but the riches of these men are nothing to the riches of our King, which are without dimension and number. Being cured and freed from the waters all the Kings, and potentates of other regions did honor and fear him: And when they were willing to see any of his wonderful works, they put one ounce of Mercury well washed in a crucible, and cast thereupon (as it were one grain of Millet seed) of his nails, or of his hair or blood, and blowed gently with coals, they let it cool with them, and found such a stone as I know. This is he, whom Count Bernhard mentions, that gives to his six courtiers so much of his kingdom, as he himself possesses, provided they wait, till he recover youth in the bath, and be adorned with various garments, namely, a black breastplate, a white shirt, and purple blood; for then he promises to give some of his blood to every one, and make them partakers of his riches . . . . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem49.html","doctitle":"Emblem 49","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA XLIX. in 5. suprà. vertendo Basin seu fugientem vocem et incipiendo ab initio in d. sic vertendo simplicem et incipiendo in fine g. & incipiendo ab initio in d. sic vertendo simplicem & incipiendo in fine g.

Hinc Raymundus, ut citat Rosarius, noster, inquit, infans habet duos patres duas matres: quia ipse charè nutritus est ex tota substan-tia in igne, propter quod nunquam moritur: Ita Dionysus seu Bac-chus bimater appellatur, quem immaturum combustâ matre ex e-jus vẽtreventre eripuit femori suo insuit, ut pater mater factus sit: Sed haec magis declarãturdeclarantur in Orionis conceptu, ɋqui ex Apollinis, Vulcani Mercurii commixtis seminibus in pelle bubula inclusis per 10 menses, natus dicitur: Monstrosa haec essent omnino, non tantùm fabulosa, nisi arcanum naturae sub his involucris lateret, non omnibomnibus obvium.

Those women, which prostitute themselves to variety of men, do seldom conceive lively children through the confusion of diverse seeds: for nature in the generation of man and the most part of animals admits no superfetation, except perhaps very rarely: and therefore every offspring is produced from one only father and mother, whether it be one or more, as is also manifest by histories and the event of some supposing otherwise; in the first place of Margarett the wife of Herman Earl of Henneberge, who, in the year 1276, brought forth three hundred and sixty five children, which were all baptized, and the males called by the name of John, and the females Elizabeth, their grave being dead is yet to be seen in the Church of Lausdune, one mile distant from the Hague towards the Sea in Holland, together with the brazen bason, in which they were baptized, and an inscription of the story: The cause alleged was, that the Countess, seeing a poor woman carry two children twins in her arms, called her adulteress, as if it was impossible for more children to be born at one conception by one man, but necessarily by several: Whereupon an imprecation being made by the poor woman, who knew her self clear of that accusation, the Countess conceived in her womb at one time and by one man so many children, as there are days in the year: This is indeed a miracle, but a natural work, which happened through the vengeance of God: But in the Philosophical work that, which is otherwise contrary to nature, is easily admitted under the veil of an allegory: For here one infant is said to have three fathers, or also two, as also mothers: Hereupon says Raymund cited by the Rosary; Our infant has two fathers and two mothers, and because he with his whole substance is tenderly nourished in fire, he therefore never dies: So Dionysus or Bacchus is said to have two mothers, who was ripped out of his mothers belly (being burned) before the time of his maturity, and matured in his fathers thigh, so that the father became a mother: But these things are better declared in the conception of Orion, who is said to be produced from the seed of Apollo, Vulcan, and Mercury mixed together, and preserved in the hide of an Ox for the space of ten months: These things would be altogether monNBenestrous, not only fabulous, if a secret of nature were not comprehended under these shrouds, not obvious to all men. Lully in the Theoric of his Testament attributes to the same Philosophical infant so many and almost the same fathers, namely Sol, who is Apollo, or the celestial Sol is the first author of this generation, who by his ineffable virtue occult or astral power operates upon a certain matter known to the Philosophers, as upon the matrix 154 of a woman, and therein produces a Son or infant like to himself, to whom afterwards he will leave and resign his arms and ensigns of virtues, by paternal right, that is, the faculty of maturing things immature, and the energy of tinging and purging things not tinged nor purged. For whatsoever Sol is able to perfect in a thousand years, that will his Son perform in half an hour; That therefore virtue may be made a thousand times stronger in him, than in Sol, his father delivers him to Vulcan and the Artist together for education, that his generous disposition may be polished and multiplied in virtues by their means; for manifest it is that to practice from a child conduces much: So Achilles, Jason, Hercules were committed to Chiron to be instructed for the same end. For Milo the Crotonian, who being a boy carried a calf, when a man carried an Ox by custom. Besides Sol, Vulcan and the artist are not erroneously reputed the fathers of this child, because as he was the first, they made him to be such and so great: No equivalent compensation can be made to Masters for institution, as neither reward to parents for generation. These compose the body, those the mind. If the mind be better than the body, no less recompense is due to those, than to these. In the production of Orion Mercury contributed matter, Apollo form, and Vulcan heat, or the external efficient cause: So also in the Philosophical work it is proper for three fathers to be seen to have conspired for the procreation of one infant, in whom the Philosophers take great delight."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/emblem50.html","doctitle":"Emblem 50","type":"emblem","fugue-de":"FUGA L. in 3. seu 10. infra.

Ipsa enim aqua solvit corpus in spi-ritum, de mortuo facit vivum, facit matrimonium inter virum mulierem. Etenim totum benficium artis facit: De terra quoque sic in-quit.

The mansion of Dragons is in caverns of the earth, but the residence of men above the earth in the immediate air; which two Elements are contrary, and appointed by the Philosophers to be joined together, that one may act upon the other: But by the woman others mean, as Basil in Key 2d. says: For it is not convenient or commodious for an Eagle to place her nest upon the Alps, because her chickens would die through the coldness of the Snow at the top of the mountains: But if you add to the Eagle a cold Dragon, which has had his habitation a long time in the rocks, and crept out of the caves of the earth, and put them both into an infernal cell, then will Pluto blow a blast, and draw a volatile fiery spirit out of the cold dragon, which with its great heat will burn the Eagles feathers, and excite such a sudorific bath, as to melt the Snow at the top of the mountains, lb/>and turn it into water; from which a miserable bath may be well prepared, contributing fortune and health to the King. Admirable indeed it is, that a cold dragon should yield a fiery Spirit; yet experience declares it to be true in burned serpents, which do send forth a venomous flame poisoning the standers by: Nor in vain are the keepers of the Chymical treasures called flammivomous dragons, as the keepers of the golden fleece, the Hesperian gardens, Cadmus, and the like. But this dragon lives in straight places of subterranean rocks, which you must there take, and join to the Eagle or woman, to her, in the grave, to the other, if you had rather, in the nest: For the nature of a dragon is sometimes to lie in wait for the Eagles eggs, and wage mortal war with the Eagle: Some there are of the Grecian writers who affirm that a dragon in times past fell in love with a maid and lay with her. What wonder therefore, if the Philosophers would have their dragon shut up in a cavern with a woman? Greverus joins red and black dragons together in the deep gulf of the mountain, and burns them with fire, and the black perishing, he says that the keeper of the mountain searchs for them every where, and brings them to the mountain. Merlin in his vision (if it be not suppositious) makes mention of a white and red dragon; These Dragons, whatsoever they be, whether one be a woman, or a female dragon, do act one with the other, till they both die, and emit blood from their wounds, wherewith they are imbrued. But here the element of earth and fire is understood by the dragon, and by the woman the element of air and water; whereupon says Clangor buccinæ: The Dragon is the matter remaining in the bottom after the water be distilled from it: And according to Hermes: The water of air being between heaven and earth is the life of every thing, for that water dissolves a body into a 157 spirit, and vivifies a dead thing, and makes matrimony between man and woman: For it confers the whole benefit of the art: Of the earth also he thus speaks. And moreover understand, that the particular earth, which we tread upon, is not the true element, yes is elemented with its true fifth element: Nor does the fifth elemental substance recede from its elemented body, of which the earth is formed. And a little after. But the Virgin and true element, which fire cannot burn, is in the center of the earth: This is the dragon, whereof we speak, insinuating itself even into the center of the earth, where the heat being great, it conceives within itself a flaming heat, wherewith it burns the woman or eagle. The woman or eagle is indeed an airy water, which some call the white or celestial eagle, and will have it made of common Mercury, or sublimed Salts, following therein the sense of some certain men blind in this art, feigning themselves to be quicksighted; But says Count Bernhard in his Epistle, I tell you truly, that no water dissolves a metallic species by natural reduction, except that which continues with it in matter and form, and which the metals themselves can recongeal: And a little after: Nor does that water appertain to bodies in solutions, which remains not with them in congelations: And a little after: I tell you truly, that the oil which naturally incerates and joins natures together, and naturally introduces a Medicine for the tinging of other bodies, is not compounded of any other extraneous thing, but only of the bowels of the body which is to be dissolved: This therefore being apprehended, the eagle and woman, as also the Dragon with the secrets of almost the whole art are understood, which perhaps we have thus far too openly explained and declared to the Sons of learning, that God may hereby be glorified . . . . ."},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/frontispiece.html","doctitle":"Frontispiece","type":"af-frontmatter","epigram-la":"","epigram-en":""},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/author-epigram.html","doctitle":"Author Epigram","type":"af-frontmatter","epigram-la":"","epigram-en":""},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/dedication.html","doctitle":"Dedication","type":"af-frontmatter","epigram-la":"","epigram-en":""},{"id":"atalanta-fugiens/preface.html","doctitle":"Preface","type":"af-frontmatter","epigram-la":"","epigram-en":""}]
