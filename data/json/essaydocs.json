It is difficult to imagine how three singers could ever have gathered around a copy of Atalanta fugiens to sing its canons. Nor is there evidence that anyone attempted to. But Maier’s curious integration of music into his enigmatic creation opened it wide indeed, to playfulness of cosmic significance. Maier included fifty three-voice contrapuntal pieces in Atalanta fugiens and structured a subsequent treatise, Cantilenae intellectuales (Intellectual Songs, 1622), around the literary conceit of poetic “counterpoint” for three voices. Yet he left just a few scattered comments on music and nothing remotely resembling a thorough statement of musical philosophy. My task, then, lies in stitching together disparate threads, searching for meaningful coherence within the fabric of Maier’s work and against the larger tapestry of his world. The tapestry I weave differs significantly from earlier accounts. I place less emphasis upon alchemy (especially in its occult formulations), which several fine scholars have already explored. Moreover, Maier was more than an (occult) alchemist, and the spacious category of musica offered him and his contemporaries a fuller range of possibilities than that label implies. To imagine those possibilities requires descending a bit from the realm of cosmic ideas in which Maier is usually placed, and entering into the quotidian conditions of early modern social and professional life. I locate Maier’s musical world among people, texts, and sounds he is likely to have encountered. These range from the gentlemen and scholars who divined and calculated a silent harmony of the heavens, to the humbler artisans who honed the techniques of counterpoint and text painting that transformed lofty words and ideas into physical sound. At times, musica manifested itself in contradictory, even inimical forms; Maier partook of them all. I therefore aim to suggest multiple ways that Atalanta fugiens could have signified in the the wide but coherent constellation of cultures—social and professional, aesthetic and scientific, metaphysical and theological—from which musical and chymical subcultures took their coordinates. List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography Missing Histories It is impossible to write the history of music and alchemy. Both pursuits encompassed a variety of cultural practices, of which the Atalanta-object materializes just a narrow selection. And, as we will see, both were shaped by common epistemological and social assumptions, according to which garden-variety practitioners were mere “mechanics.” The learned and privileged held them in low regard and considered them to have little intellectual life worth recording. Thus, whole realms of cultural production have left behind relatively few evidentiary traces. This is especially true at the nexus of chymistry and music. The scarcity of sources has led, on the one hand, to overinterpretation of those few that exist. In the case of Atalanta fugiens, one scholar describes the canons as “incantations,” evidence that alchemists commonly “incorporated some type of [secret] musical practice in their ritual.” At the same time, other scholars have dismissed the occasional testimony of a musician’s alchemical activities, as in the correspondence of Maier’s contemporary Claudio Monteverdi. The editor of a recent edition of the composer’s letters assures readers that the real attraction of [the pseudo-science] lay not so much in its scientific aspect as in its symbolism and its pretence towards a search for perfection . . . Monteverdi’s involvement could not have been all that deep, and perhaps . . . in the nature of a pastime . . . part and parcel of an amusing diversion. That conclusion is possible, given Monteverdi’s light touch in these letters; it certainly helps to safeguard the prescient intelligence one expects from a canonic genius, and especially from the supposed “creator of modern music.” Yet to assume that Monteverdi’s epistolary playfulness amounts to mere irony, or mere insincerity, would underestimate the complexity of seventeenth-century wit. (Monteverdi, after all, chose his Scherzi musicali (Musical Jests, 1607) as the forum for the lengthiest, most defensive statement of musical principles.) This world delighted in profound wit and serious jest, as Maier’s titles Lusus serius (1616) and Jocus severus (1617) testify. Metaphors and conceits could signify at multiple levels of reality, rendering it difficult for modern scholars to draw firm boundaries between underinterpretation and overkill. In Maier’s case, recent research makes that boundary more ambiguous still. Loren Ludwig’s extraordinary discovery—that Maier lifted the bulk of Atalanta fugiens’ canons from John Farmer’s Diuers & sundry waies (1591)—complicates any simple notions about Maier’s beliefs and his claims to authorship. As new documents continue to emerge, so does a new, less-idealized Maier: a flesh-and-blood rascal, not just a mind consumed with cosmic thoughts. Perhaps the presence of music in this alchemical emblem book records less about the author’s musical-metaphysical convictions than about his pressing need to attract a patron by demonstrating a unique gift. (Sadly, the expense of printing Atalanta fugiens exacerbated, rather than improved, his dire financial straits.) Whatever Maier’s beliefs and motivations, that is to say, he engineered an object capable of provoking conversation and reflection far beyond the printed page. To understand the world for which it was designed, we begin by reconstructing the musical milieu that Maier himself might have inhabited. Medicus, Magus, Musicus If we take Maier at his word, he had a firm “grasp [of] both the theory and practice of music.” But we know little about his musical life and—in light of his musical borrowings—it appears that we knew even less than we’d thought. Nevertheless, using the autobiographical account in Maier’s recently rediscovered De medicina regia (On the Regal Medicine, 1609), I attempt to fill out the picture by placing him among figures whom he is likely to have known or whose education and career likely resembled his. As for his intellectual formation, Maier recalled his boyhood studies of the trivium and music at the local school. But it isn’t clear whether this instruction was theoretical, practical, or both. Paul Raasveld plausibly suggests that Maier was familiar with Johannes Lippius’ Synopsis novae musicae (Synopsis of New Music, 1612). Yet I find it altogether more likely that Maier’s musical thought was shaped by an important teacher and by a fellow student during his years at the University of Rostock (1587–1591). In Rostock he almost certainly would have studied medicine and quadrivial subjects under the distinguished physician and mathematician Heinrich Brucaeus. Brucaeus published widely in both fields, and Maier later cited his writings. To fulfill his polymathic ambition, Brucaeus pursued music in his scholarship and pedagogy, as revealed in Musica theorica (Music Theory), published posthumously in 1609. The short treatise presents Brucaeus’ exegeses of Euclidian texts. In fact, since Musica theorica consists of lecture materials (possibly in a student’s transcription), it may offer a direct glimpse into Maier’s musical education at University: resolutely mathematical, focused upon ratios of pitch, rooted in classical sources, without immediate application to practice. The editor of Music Theory, Joachim Burmeister, expressed surprise that Brucaeus should write so discerningly about musical science despite lacking even rudimentary musical ability. However, the world of the theorist was rarely coterminous that of the practitioner, as we will see. Although not mentioned in previous studies of Atalanta fugiens, Burmeister himself should be a figure of considerable interest. A music theorist who later held the post of Kantor in Rostock, he worked as a musician in two of the city’s principal churches and studied with Brucaeus during Maier’s time at the University. Burmeister’s Hypomnematum musicae poeticae (Notes on a Synopsis of Musical Poetics, 1599) linked incipient notions of triadic harmony to the Trinitarian thought that exercised a profound influence upon Maier’s musical metaphysics. It is not far-fetched to imagine young Michael Maier engaging Burmeister and Brucaeus in erudite musical conversation. What of his experiences with sounding music? Here, too, evidence is slender. The aviary conceit of his Jocus severus might suggest a sensitivity to birdsong. (On the other hand, birds provided conventional Decknamen, code names for alchemical materials, for volatiles.) He mentions having heard the hydraulic organ at the Medicean Villa Pratolino. He must have heard contemporary music in Italy, Prague, and London. His London sojourn was crucial for Atalanta fugiens, since it was almost certainly there that he encountered Farmer’s canons. On the basis of internal evidence, I suspect that he also encountered William Bathe’s A briefe introduction to the skill of Song (c. 1596). Bathe’s humble treatise, which offered rough guidance in composing two-voice canons above a plainsong cantus firmus, could have come in handy when Maier filled out the blank spaces in Atalanta fugiens (see Table 1). In 1611, Maier presented James I with an elaborate poetic greeting, complete with a four-voice canon above an ostinato. Simon Smith speculates that this canon, and perhaps others destined for Atalanta fugiens, may have been used in a performance of Shakespeare’s alchemically resonant The Winter’s Tale, given at court in 1612–1613 to celebrate the union of James’ daughter Elizabeth to Frederick V. Maier was certainly on the scene, having been listed among Frederick’s “gentlemen” at the funeral of James’ son Henry in November 1612. Yet it seems somewhat improbable that he—rather than one of the fine musicians associated with the English court—would have been entrusted with such a task. Was Maier sufficiently skilled to have composed canons—even bad ones? In De medicina regia, he claims that his mother paid two years’ tuition to an unnamed, “more celebrated school” than that at which he studied music and the trivium. I would suggest the Gymnasium of Bordesholm, just outside Kiel. Although this Fürstenschule served the sons of the aristocracy, students also hailed from working-class families, especially those who (like Maier’s) served the Holstein court. One such student was Erasmus Sartorius, a choirboy at court. Princely support enabled him to attend Bordesholm in the early 1590s, where he also served as organist. Bordesholm prepared him for Rostock which, in turn, prepared him for a career resembling Burmeister’s: an important municipal cantorate and publication of music treatises that displayed his authorial skill with the sort of rich, allusive Latin prose and poetry at which Maier also excelled. It was common in Lutheran lands, well into the eighteenth century, for such students to defray tuition by singing in the liturgy. If Maier did so, he would have learned, at minimum, to sing melodies from musical notation. Instruction often extended to singing polyphony and, in some cases, to the rudiments of contrapuntal composition. Maier claimed that Atalanta fugiens’ fugues were given “by my Muse” [dat mea Musa fugas] and that he himself carefully “wrote and proofed” them [fugas illas musicales . . . summâ diligentiâ scripsi & revidi]. The unacknowledged presence of Farmer’s entire opus within Atalanta fugiens tells a rather different story. Maier’s “Muse” was likely no more celestial than a bookstall; in hindsight, we might even take scripsi as “copied down.” The choice of Farmer’s obscure print could suggest that he hoped to escape detection. The same held for Maier’s friend Johannes Staricius, a poet laureate, chymist, and organist. Portions of Staricius’ Newer teutscher weltlicher Lieder (New German Secular Songs, 1609) are neither new nor German, but rather consist of unacknowledged borrowings from Thomas Morley’s madrigals and ballets, published in the 1590s by the same London firm that printed Bathe’s and Farmer’s work. Nor can we simply assume that Maier composed the remaining ten pieces; possibly, he commissioned them from some as-yet-unknown musician. Since canon was closely associated with recondite learning, contrapuntal “borrowing” (with varying degrees of attribution) was a common strategy for authors to present themselves as more skillful and erudite than they actually were. Maier used all forty of Farmer’s waies, but that still left him ten fugues short. Two flights of fugues, 21–30 and 31–40, preserve Farmer’s sequence fairly accurately. This could point to an earlier, differently ordered incarnation of Atalanta fugiens. Of Atalanta fugiens’ first twenty fugues, Maier took only the even-numbered from Farmer. He still needed ten fugues to fill in the odd-numbered slots. As it turns out, these ten “mystery fugues” are a virtuoso display of incompetence. For instance, before Fugue 11 completes the first poetic line, it has already charged through a briar of improbable dissonances and parallel perfect intervals—including one instance where all voices move simultaneously in forbidden parallels. The Burmeisters of the era devoted countless pages to warning against such solecisms of musical grammar and syntax. Even allowing for Maier’s choice of an archaic idiom in which open intervals are acceptable, it is still a feat to violate so many sacrosanct theoretical precepts in so short a space. Fugue 11 certainly merits its epigram: Tear up the books!

La La to nae so La to to nae so bo bo lem nae so bo lem non non no vit lem non no vit ne ne mo no vit engraved with Musica: The Noble Science In any event, compositional competence was somewhat beside the point. As commentators long ago pointed out, Atalanta fugiens’ vast symbolic ambition far outweighs technical finesse. Maier did not necessarily need to demonstrate complete mastery of the craft, but only a basic fitness of musical and literary conceits. His final flight of borrowings, 41–50, does so imaginatively. Moreover, musical finesse and competence, and the technical study required to attain them, once held a very different status. They were the domain of the craftsman; the cult of the “Musical Genius” was centuries away. Maier distanced himself from craft at the outset of Atalanta fugiens. His imposing self-presentation as “Count, Knight, and Doctor of Medicine” bespoke status far above that of professional musicians (fig. 1). In a single glance it communicates power, erudition, wealth, lineage, renown. It is a façade for his literary performance, as expected in an era when the theatrical stage provided the dominant metaphor for public life: theatrum mundi [The Great Theater of the World]. It exudes a confident sophistication that belies a hungrier reality. Maier had been ennobled, but was not of the nobility. He was a gold embroiderer’s son and, in 1617, the ink on his escutcheon was scarcely dry. The escutcheon suggests a storied lineage but was in fact one of Maier’s ingenious concoctions. Figala, Neumann, and others have recently unearthed archival documents that allow a peek behind the mask. Maier spent his university career fleeing debt and scandal, his mature career chasing patrons. That he dedicated Atlanta fugiens, his intricate jewelbox, to the Mühlhausen town council cannot be taken as a sign of high status, either financial, professional, or social.

Within many of those enterprises, including music and chymistry, fissures ran between theorists and practitioners that tracked neatly with those of social rank. Take the emblem of musico-chymical harmony devised by Jacques de Senlecque for Basil Valentine’s Révélation des mystères (Revelation of Mysteries, 1646) (fig. 2). Senlecque intones parallel scales between treatises of seven alchemical authors and seven alchemical preparations that result from operations of Paracelsian spagyria. He fills out that sonority with another parallel scale for the discipline of music. The scale of a seven-piped organ corresponds to the seven celestial bodies, which were in turn associated with the traditional seven metals. The celestial bodies, therefore, establish the link between chymistry and music, and of both to the macrocosm. The heavenly organum, metaphor for the greater organon, stands as Christian substitute for Apollo’s seven-stringed lyre and Pan’s seven pipes. It is the warrant for musica instrumentalis, in the form of a seven-stringed, seven-fretted viol. The visual-verbal pun between the “viol” of music and the “vial” [phial] of chymistry exemplifies “profound wit.” The similarity of words that name dissimilar objects is a sign that both draw upon the same concealed powers to effect human healing. Figure 2 Read more assertively, Senlecque’s image forcefully attempts to harmonize what were actually dissonant socio-professional relationships in both musical and chymical cultures. While all three scales move in smooth parallel motion, they sing in different registers. Chymical theoria appears above, and separated from, practica. Likewise, the celestial organ is a disembodied rank of pipes in a realm above the viol, whose bow indicates the physical activity of music-making. Early seventeenth-century erudites did not dignify physical labor; they dissociated themselves from its taint. One of Maier’s readers exemplifies enduring tensions between theory and practice, musical and chymical. At mid-century, Athanasius Kircher touted his numerical system of “automatic” music as more rational than—and superior to—the act of composition; likewise, he reported that in the chymical laboratory, he gave the orders that menials executed. It is increasingly clear that Maier carried out substantial laboratory work—to the dismay of his neighbors—and that he was capable of writing about chymistry in straightforward, technical prose. Thus it is significant that he located Atalanta fugiens somewhat far “from the world of laboratory practice,” as Lawrence Principe observes. The printed page offered a more visible forum than the laboratory, making it all the more important for Maier to use print as a vehicle to distinguish himself from what Tara Nummedal calls “entrepreneurial chemists.” It would have been useful for him to have publicly discredited rank-and-file practitioners as betrüger [frauds], and he devoted a treatise to doing just that: Examen fucorum pseudo-chymicorum (Swarm of Pseudo-Chymical Drones, 1617). Of everything that must be understood about the Theoretical part of this Philosophy, the Pseudo-chymist has an insufficient or superficial acquaintance, and therefore is here as if deprived of an eye. And I fear that, because he would not see much with the other ([as it] is turned toward practice), he is thus blinder than a mole. For, in practice, which operations can he execute? Certainly not the Philosophical ones, but [instead only] deceptive ones, and those that pertain to this art no more than do straw and chaff to wheat. In Maier’s distinctive formulation of chemistry, of which Atalanta fugiens is an intense distillation, preoccupation with social status is the volatile. The true chymist, he argues, is versed in astronomy, physics, geometry, arithmetic, grammar, rhetoric, poetics, philology, logic, medicine. These terrifying job requirements are really just the university education that remained the prerogative of the privileged. Take Maier’s rant, replace pseudo-chymist with pseudo-musicus, and you’ve got yourself a good seventeenth-century music treatise. Here, too, privileged theorists denounced common practitioners: the latter had debased the ideal of “living musically” to a synonym for gross sensuality. In their sensuality, they relied on the fallacious judgment of the ears rather than the intellect. In their utter ignorance of arithmetic, geometry, Greek, Latin, and poetics, they maimed musica at every turn. Many theorists of this stamp were nobles and aristocrats, or intellectuals in their midst. Among the few composers to win their unalloyed acclaim was Don Carlo Gesualdo, the dark prince of Venosa. Gesualdo’s music went beyond expressing texts; it intensified them through harmonic progressions so unusual as to nearly defeat performers. It epitomizes a true musica reservata that “nobly” flouted the economy of everyday utility to which the professional was bound. Such attitudes explain the defensive statements, in many publications devoted to musica practica (such as Bathe’s and Farmer’s), about the “nobility” of the craft. Nowadays, this theory-practice rift can seem a bit counterintuitive because the categories of “theory” and “practice” have shifted. The modern music theory curriculum progressively manipulates intervals to develop such skills as improvisation and composition. To the seventeenth-century intellectual, those lay closer to “mere” musica practica. True musica theorica or speculativa considered the same intervals, but rather as mathematical abstractions and manifestations of a deeper order. Individual compositions amounted to epiphenomena, more or less pleasing in their way, but of a far lower order than the objects of musica speculativa. “Sounding number” [numerus sonorus], as Maier’s contemporaries understood that concept, traced back to the mathematical thought of Pythagoras. Tradition credited him with discovering that musical intervals could be expressed as numerical proportion. The fourth, fifth, and octave formed the tetraktys, an interlocking series of ratios [4:3:2:1], whose terms yield the divine number, 10. This discovery, at once scientific and metaphysical, formed the basis for the central Pythagorean teaching “All is number.” According to this doctrine, musical proportion not only governed musical sound; it was the organizing principle of the heavenly spheres. Early modern thinkers were often deeply syncretic. Because they accounted for Greek learning as deriving from Moses and the Biblical Hebrews, they easily folded Pythagorean thought into Scriptural exegesis. Writers in mathematical disciplines (including Maier) often invoked Wisdom 11:21, which states that God ordered the universe by “number, weight, and measure.” This verse conditioned the interpretation of two other passages. Genesis 4:21–22 tersely describes Jubal as “father of them that play upon the harp and the organs,” and his brother Tubalcain as “hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron.” These offered proof that God had revealed musical science to antediluvian Hebrews. The mention of metallic artifice led many to discern a divine revelation of alchemy; the mention of “hammering,” to conclude that the frequently conflated Jubal-Tubal actually referred to Pythagoras and his musical discovery in the ring of blacksmiths’ hammers. Maier’s genealogies of prisca sapientia [pristine or ancient wisdom] sometimes credited Pythagoras with discovering intervals; at others, with transmitting the intervals that Hermes discovered (“since all things exist according to weight, number, and measure”). In either case, it was no stretch to interpret a third verse, Job 38:37 (“Who can make the harmony of heaven to sleep?”), as proof of a silent Pythagorean musica mundana (Music of the Spheres) in the Christian cosmos. Pythagorean musical philosophy, in Boethius’ late-Antique formulation, persisted in early-modern university curricula. Like the Pythagoreans, Boethius drew from musical mathematics broad and somewhat surprising consequences. Here again, we find that basic terms such as “music” and “musician” were once defined quite differently. Boethius divided music into three classes along a hierarchical continuum. The Music of the Spheres [musica mundana] took pride of place, followed by a music of the human body and soul [musica humana], fashioned by God according to harmonious proportions. What we today call “music” [musica instrumentalis] occupied the very lowest rung. It appeared most real; in fact, it was the most illusory. For Boethius, true musica was a science of mathematical speculation, not the irrational craft of music-making. It did not necessarily imply audibility or sound. It was a silent principle of cosmic order. Epistemological distinctions mapped onto those of social class. The true musicus was an aristocratic philosopher like Boethius or Maier. The cantor—our “musician”—was a literal and figurative slave, a brute bound to the physical production of sensible sound. Notably, given Atalanta fugiens’ musical conceit, Maier used Boethian rhetoric to attack pseudo-chymists: they were “asses [attempting] the lyre—that is, utterly remote from all good learning and intention.” By contrast, Maier recommends the soundless songs of Cantilenae intellectuales to a deep interior reflection [profundâ mente] drawn from Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy. Maier envisioned a musical experience far richer than mere reading: A sort of three-voice musical echo will result within [the reader], affecting and sweetening not so much the ears with sound, but rather the mind by an internal sense in the manner of Aspendius, who was said to sing within himself. For just as ardent prayers poured forth to God are considered to be cried out (albeit silently and without noise), so also are the harmonies of [these] songs to be perceived in the silence of the intellect. If Maier found it difficult to explain the phenomenon precisely, it will be no easier for us four centuries later. Still, it suggests another way to understand the music of Cantilenae intellectuales, Hymnosophia, Atalanta fugiens, and, potentially, a great deal more: not quite sounding, not quite silent, but somewhere between. Early moderns read poetry with a deep awareness of meter. The quantitative meters of Latin verse were trained intensively in the early years of their education, reinforced over a lifetime of liturgical hymnody. A musical conceit—even the bare layout of poetry on a page—could stimulate deeply inculcated patterns. As the eye moved silently across the pages of Cantilenae intellectuales, the reader musicked the poetry, the mind’s ear supplying the rhythms of anacreontic meter and perhaps even the melody used to memorize it. But due to suspicion of the physical in both Greek and Christian traditions, Maier’s contemporaries harbored ambivalent attitudes toward sounding music. It emanated a sensual presence capable of corrupting souls and an alchemical power capable of ennobling them. Despite the risk, Maier claimed, alchemy and music were worthy of liberales—well-educated, well-heeled gentlemen. In Lutheran Germany, the requirements of the liturgy somewhat narrowed the rift between musicus and cantor. Since women were bound to “keep silent in churches” (1 Corinthians 14:34), the local lateinschule [Latin School] or university provided a steady stream of boy trebles for a city’s principal churches. This meant that a relatively high proportion of well-educated Lutherans had effectively spent their formative years as semi-professional musicians. Moreover, the municipal liturgical machine was overseen by the Kantor, an organist-composer whose post frequently required him to teach Latin at the school. The latter obligation resulted in a Kantorate that was formally educated to a degree sufficient to master the trivium (but not necessarily the advanced disciplines that comprised the quadrivium, physics, and metaphysics). Nevertheless, Maier positioned himself not among Kantors, but rather among the privileged intellectuals who devoted Latin treatises to musical metaphysics and mathematics. His London and Prague sojourns brought him into the spheres of the two most prominent and controversial: Robert Fludd and Johannes Kepler. Musica’s Universal Resonance Soon after Atalanta fugiens’ publication, Fludd and Kepler entered a dispute about cosmic harmony that would have far-reaching consequences for the conceptualization of music. Both affirmed a universe structured by music, but they disagreed about the means to demonstrate it: philosophical speculation and occult correspondences (Fludd, fig. 3a), or calculation founded upon empirical observation (Kepler, fig. 3b). Figure 3a Figure 3b For our purposes, it is notable that Kepler and his partisans, in attacking Fludd’s work, drew attention to its alchemical resonances. Kepler contrasted Fludd’s methodology (concealing Nature’s secrets “in shadowy enigmas” after the manner of “Chymists, Hermetics, Paracelsians”) with his own (using mathematics to bring “matters shrouded in darkness into the light of understanding”). Pierre Gassendi mocked Fludd for finding hints of “any old consonance” in chymical practices, and expressed surprise that he “took pains to express these things on paper.” Marin Mersenne approved of Kepler’s method as mathematical, deriving results from “the compass,” whereas Fludd’s was “chymical,” using “furnaces and fire.” Nevertheless, scholars overemphasize Fludd and Kepler’s differences at the expense of their significant common ground. They shared with each other, and with Maier, fundamental assumptions: that music was a numerical science and that it pervaded the cosmic and metaphysical order. “If therefore we sing [in Atalanta fugiens], it is not inappropriate,” Maier wrote, “since the Angels sing (as Sacred Writ shows), the heavens sing, as Pythagoras maintained, & they tell out the glory of God, as the Psalmist says.” Considered in this context, Atalanta fugiens’ combination of alchemy, music and metaphysics doesn’t seem so idiosyncratic. Nevertheless, it is difficult to articulate a coherent musical metaphysics from this single work. Clues are scattered across the corpus of Maier’s writings, most of which appeared in the narrow span of six years, 1616–1622. Atalanta fugiens’ first emblem bears a cryptic motto from the Tabula smaragdina (Emerald Tablet), purportedly the work of Hermes Trismegistus: “The [North] Wind bore it in his belly.” Through emblem and epigram (fig. 4), Maier explicates the two fundamental substances of Jabirian theory; here, the fetus (sulfur) is borne by Boreas (mercury). Maier alludes not only to the material substances from which all elements derive but also—since Boreas gestates a human form—to the continuity and interrelation of operations divine and human, spiritual and material, celestial and terrestrial. The discourse extends the continuity to embrace various branches of knowledge and intellectual inquiry. Now the question is; who he is, that ought to be carried by wind? I answer, Chymically, it is Sulphur, which is carried in Argent vive, as Lully in his book, Chapt 32 attests, and all the rest; physically, it is an infant, which ought in a little time to be borne born into the world: I say also Arithmetically, that it is the root of a Cube; Musically, that it is the Disdiapason [double octave]; Geometrically, that it is a punctum the beginning of a running line; Astronomically, the center of the planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. Figure 4 Add to Collection This commentary bears comparison to a passage in Thomas Norton’s Ordinall of alchimy, which Maier published in Latin translation the same year as Atalanta fugiens. Norton wrote that the chymist should combine physical substances according to the rules of artistic and scientific disciplines including arithmetic and music. Among the musical proportions “very like” those of chymistry are the octave, fifth, and fourth; combined, they yield the double octave, which is both the interval of Maier’s discourse and the first harmonic sonority of the corresponding fugue. More important than the specific interval (to which we shall return) is the unity of knowledge that Maier’s comments presuppose. This presumed unity was especially intimate among the quadrivial disciplines, speaking as they did a single language of number. Seventeenth-century intellectual culture witnessed the apex of the polymathic ideal: the mastery of universal rather than specialist knowledge. This enabled music to serve as a category of analysis in a variety of disciplines. For this reason, mathematicians and astronomers (such as Kepler, Kircher, and Mersenne) were also the prominent music theorists. Also for this reason, medics and chymists (such as Fludd and Maier) incorporated music into their work. Music, chymistry, and medicine all aimed to channel great and sometimes mysterious forces toward transformations. The venerable concept of musica humana therefore warranted explorations of iatromusica, music applied to medicine. Maier falls into a long tradition of thinkers who mapped the mathematics of pitch onto the body and healing practices. In his memorably titled Civitas corporis humani, a tyrannide arthritica vindicata (City of the Human Body Liberated from Arthritic Tyranny, 1621), Maier compared body parts to polyphonic voices. “Just as in music sweet-sounding harmony arises from various notes [together] and not just a single one,” he wrote, “so also in [this] city.” This pleasing metaphor stated a higher reality that had anatomical manifestations and practical medical applications. Atalanta fugiens opened with the idea, central also to Fludd’s writings, that “man is a compendium of the universe.” Emblem 21 (fig. 5) joins a woman to the traditional Vitruvian man. Hermes Trismegistus inscribes them within a circle (for the soul’s divine nature) and a square (for the body’s material nature). They are further inscribed by a triangle and a circle, all of which have chymical significance. Hermes works with square, compass, and quadrant, the traditional tools of geometer, architect, and astronomer. Man, then, is a “compendium of the universe” precisely by virtue of musical proportions: they shape our bodies and bewitch our souls. Indeed, in Lusus serius (A Serious Jest), Maier places this Platonic idea in the mouth of a sheep. Music is everywhere in this emblem, even if Maier doesn’t show it. Figure 5 Add to Collection As usual, the specific details are tougher to work out and require gathering fragments scattered across his other writings. In Cantilenae intellectuales he posits a specific macro-microcosmic relationship between planets and bodily organs. A major third, perfect fifth, and octave result from the proportional distances of Earth to Moon, Sun, and fixed stars, and from feet to liver, heart, and brain. The ratios extend the tetraktys by one term [5:4:3:2:1]; the intervals form the harmonic triad that would hold such significance for Maier. He explains these relationships more fully in an unlikely place, Verum inventum, hoc est munera Germaniae (The True Discovery, or The Gifts of Germany, 1619). Here he praises German contributions to civilization, especially Charlemagne’s brilliant establishment of the Holy Roman Empire and its governance by seven electors. The electors didn’t always see eye to eye, so Maier turned to planetary motions to explain a musica politica in which occasional dissonances between individual voices contribute to overall harmony. Music functions similarly in heaven and cities, literal and arthritic. The triadic harmony from Cantilenae intellectuales fits precisely within the planetary ratios of Verum inventum. Both, moreover, correspond exactly to the middle portion of Fludd’s celestial monochord (fig. 3b). Furthermore, Maier described his ratios as “measured not so much arithmetically or geometrically as physically [i.e., qualitatively],” which is essentially the explanation Fludd offered for his own work in Veritatis proscenium (The Stage of Truth, 1621). In retrospect, the double-octave ambitus of Fludd’s cosmic monochord offers insight into Maier’s chymical double octave. This is not to say that Maier took his ideas from Fludd’s work, although he certainly came to know it. But it does suggest that his scattered observations on musical mathematics were, to some degree, coherently integrated with his ideas on medicine, chymistry, and astronomy. Transformative Powers: Canons and Enigmas If musica instrumentalis was the lowest form of musica, it nonetheless existed on a continuum with higher forms. The final sections of this paper harmonize high and low, silent and sounding, through two specific musical techniques used in the Atalanta fugiens: canon and text painting. As I have said, canon justly carried strong associations with recondite learning. First, there is the sheer difficulty of writing good imitative counterpoint: success requires foreseeing the potentials and pitfalls implicit in a canonic subject so that polyphony grows “automatically” from a thematic seed, according to a grammar of consonance, dissonance, and harmonic progression. It’s useful to reiterate—if only because models of musical listening have changed since then—that every element of musical grammar could be represented as numerical proportion. When Maier’s contemporaries defined music as sounding number, this is what they meant. Listened to in this way, music has little to do with subjective self-expression. It is an artful dance of fixed ratios. Second, throughout its long history, composers invested canon with symbolic significance. Resolutions and even subjects might be encrypted in allusive emblems, oracular mottos, shadowy enigmas, and other so-called hieroglyphs. Thus, canon cast an aura of the venerable and erudite. At the same time, it offered a socially exclusive forum for wit and play, which Laurie Stras describes as unfolding in “an almost ritualistic display of knowledge, wit, and rhetorical skill.” The musical object, therefore, receded in importance before the external actions it provoked. The simultaneity of hermeneutic ambiguity and ambition reminds us that Maier borrowed a musical technique whose true significance might lie somewhere other than its sounding surface. It suited his quest for things “august, sublime, sacred, rare, and concealed.” Its “secrets” were to be pondered orally, aurally, visually, and intellectually, holding out the promise of passing from sonic pleasure to intellectual enlightenment. Yet Maier may have also suspected that Atalanta fugiens’ readers would not appreciate too much subtlety. He solved for them the riddles of canonic resolution: he presented all vocal parts on a single page, stated explicitly the canonic procedures, and translated the epigrams into the vernacular. The three vocal lines themselves may harbor “sacred, sublime” theological meaning in addition to their personification of mythical figures. As we have seen, Maier posited harmonic triads in the macro- and microcosm. The triad was only just then being theorized as an independent musical object. Even so, several writers had already discerned great significance in a single consonant sonority arising from three simultaneous pitches. Burmeister heard it as a sort of musical hypostasis: The harmonic art is both divine and a divine gift . . . its most hidden mysteries flow from the venerable Trinity, whence music takes its origin . . . Of the things that concern this art, all consist of the ternary number, are constituted by it, fulfill their ends through it. Trinitarian symbolism looms large in Maier’s collections of poetic “songs.” He dedicated Hymnosophia to the “one and triune God.” His Cantilenae intellectuales consists of three “triads” of three songs (cantilenae) for three voices: Venus (high), Pisces (middle), and Leo (low). (Elsewhere, Maier credits Hermes himself with establishing this tripartite division of voices.) In the final triad, which addresses the Trinity, the bass (Leo) sings of eternal joys such as “the ear has not heard / and have evaded all senses.” And so, Maier must abandon entirely the realm of musica instrumentalis, which had embellished Atalanta fugiens. The Cantilenae intellectuales include no musical notation; they are a silent music “not so much for the audible voice, as for deep reflection.” The richest, but most elusive, Trinitarian imagery may lie in the Golden Apple of Atalanta fugiens. The three-voice cantilenae, obviously, form numerous harmonic triads. The two canonic voices (Atalanta and Hippomenes) are always accompanied by a slow-moving fragment (Pomum) from an ancient Gregorian Kyrie. The Kyrie text, a tripartite invocation whose individual sections are uttered three times, had been used in chymical works that Maier knew. The Kyrie melody used in Atalanta fugiens, the Cunctipotens genitor Deus (All-Powerful Creator), was also sung to a Trinitarian trope that addresses God as “creator of all things,” Christ as “healer” and manifestation of Divine wisdom [Sophia], and the Holy Spirit as “advancing flame, fount of life, purifying force.” This theological imagery could easily take on medical and chymical significance. Both melody and text endured in Lutheran hymnody as O ewiger barmherziger Gott (O eternal, merciful God). Are these Trinitarian resonances among the “secrets” Maier promised? Was he even aware of them? If so, the amalgam of chymical and Trinitarian symbolism suggests that something more than simple convenience motivated Maier’s musical borrowings. But since neither he nor Farmer discussed the chant or text, it remains a mystery. Hearing Symbols, Seeing Sound With Atalanta fugiens, Maier engineered a multimedia object whose elements interact across the sensorium in complex ways. Textual and visual elements could, as we have seen, stimulate an internal sense of hearing. The fifty fugues, in turn, animated static images with dramatic temporality and, through the technique of text painting (or “madrigalisms”), made the visual audible. Maier’s musical ingenuity apparently did not lie in compositional skill. It lay rather in his ability to convert Farmer’s untexted and somewhat abstract canons into a complex mythological and chymical allegory. To do so, he employed devices of musical mimesis whereby notes and pitches take up the visual burden of the emblem and poetry. The music imitates the text through the contour of vocal lines and general contrapuntal procedure, rather than through harmony. On the printed page, Maier presented the music synoptically, following the format used by Farmer and Bathe. Unlike a modern score, this format does not enable the reader to “hear” the harmonic flow with the mind’s ear. Nevertheless, it allows her to see the music’s most important expressive features. The strong visual component reveals the influence of musica poetica upon Maier. For theorists of musica poetica such as Burmeister, the composer was a rhetorician with the same aims as the preacher or poet. These can be summarized with three Classical commonplaces. Docere, movere, delectare: the orator should simultaneously teach, move, and delight, according to Cicero and Augustine. Ut pictura poesis: writing should aspire to the vividness of painting for Horace, and even—sub oculos subiiciendis—seem to place the subject itself before the eyes, in Quintilian’s view. Maier employed text painting, an effective and obvious tool, at the level of individual word and overarching idea. At times, canonic procedure itself expresses simple textual ideas such as likeness (imitare, Fugue 3) and conjunction (conjunge, Fugue 4). At other times, it expresses more complex concepts. In Fugue 10, Hippomenes’ voice rising out of Atalanta’s gives a musical emblem for “mercury from mercury, fire from fire,” while the whole musical complex is a fit image for the great “machine of the world” [machina . . . mundi]. Maier either tailored his poetry to the shape of the vocal lines or chose canons that fit poetry he had already written. Words signifying speed, flight, fire, and suddenness are often paired with rapid melismas. Motion by seconds suits binis in Fugue 15; the leaping subject of Fugue 27 misses the sense of luxuriat but captures the clumsy gait of the Emblem’s footless man. Excerpt from Fugue 27 ▶ Lu xu ri at, lu xu ri at So phi ae The demands of strophic poetry complicated Maier’s task. Each fugue set only one or two lines of the six-line epigrams, requiring each piece to be sung several times to different words. In Epigram 7, Maier places images of flight and fall at roughly the same position in each couplet. As a result, each lands near a generically appropriate melisma. On the other hand, and especially in the earlier fugues, the expressive relation of text and music seems more neutral. Sometimes a single piece contains both congruities and incongruities. In Fugue 16, images of flight [quae volat] and immobility [immotus] are fitted to quick melismatic ascents. Such moments call interpretive criteria into question. Are we reading too deeply into this music, having already decided that it is a sphinx waiting to be decoded? Then again, Maier himself created that impression at the outset: since the fugues concealed “precious secrets,” they warranted “seeing, reading, meditation, understanding, and discerning” (and only then, “singing and listening”). Thus he cleverly shifted the burden of meaning-making onto readers—contemporaneous and modern—who can solve riddles he never posed. Excerpts from Fugue 16 Engraved by Verovio 2.1.0-dev-[undefined] Quae vo lat et se cum Engraved by Verovio 2.1.0-dev-[undefined] im mo tus stat Nevertheless, the final ten fugues leave no doubt that an intricate musical allegory is present. Maier gathered together the most “artificial” (that is, artful) of Farmer’s waies to illustrate the dramatic climax of the Atalanta myth. They fully display Maier’s ingenuity, as Hildemarie Streich’s reading demonstrates. Through recherché contrapuntal devices such as retrograde motion, thematic inversion, and even a sort of prolation canon, we “see” Hippomenes catch up to fleet-footed Atalanta (Fugue 47), who hesitates before the golden apples he throws. Large-scale structural and procedural images are accented by subtler details. As Atalanta and Hippomenes speed and slacken by turns, the apple remains more or less constant, like gold itself; it bears a melody in Dorian, the mode associated with the Sun, from which gold takes its sign. Such techniques were part of the broader arsenal of musica poetica, for which several German commentators provided guidelines and copious examples. The lion’s share came from the music of Orlando Lassus, easily the most famous composer of Maier’s world. The physician Samuel Quickelberg praised Lassus’ ability to “express the Psalms so fittingly by adapting the music to the subject and text, drawing out the force of each affect, and by placing the subject before the eyes as if in real life.” In his famous Tristis est anima mea (My soul is sorrowful), a fuga “emblematizes” Christ’s prediction that his disciples will abandon him [vos fugam capietur]. The descending profile of the subject makes each of the eleven imitative entries (Judas has already betrayed Christ) appear to fade into the distance. Lassus’ motets enjoyed great popularity in German-speaking lands; they were widely anthologized and frequently sung in Lutheran services. Theorists such as Burmeister and Sartorius cited his motets by the dozens, clearly expecting readers to have encountered them in choir. They are the only polyphonic music mentioned by Kepler, for whom (as D. P. Walker argues) the invention of polyphony was of epochal significance since it was founded in the same archetypes as the Harmony of the Spheres, “the geometric beauties coeternal with the Creator.” Indeed, Peter Pesic speculates that Kepler considered the semitones of Lassus’ In me transierunt (Thy wrath has passed over me) “a powerful treatment of the song of the Earth, embedding the earthly semitone in a rich constellation of sonorities that suggest the full universal harmony . . . [a sign] of terrestrial dissonance that can be reconciled in celestial harmony.” It is difficult to imagine that Maier, in his studies and in worship, would not have encountered Lassus’ music frequently. Some contemporaneous critics, such as Vincenzo Galilei (father of the astronomer), ridiculed text painting as ineffective; many contemporary scholars have even more difficulty accepting this somewhat remote means of expression. In the monumental Oxford History of Western Music (2005), Richard Taruskin, analyzing the extravagant plague-paintings of Handel’s Israel in Egypt (1739), concludes that the technique is a rather juvenile gimmick: Tediously cataloguing the means by which such vivid effects are achieved has the same dampening effect as does the explanation of a joke . . . [yet] it may also serve a good purpose if it forces us to realize and confront, through our annoyance . . . that these marvelous and musically epochal illustrations are indeed, for the most part, no more (and no less) than jokes . . . they depend on mechanisms of humor: puns . . . wit . . . caricature. It’s an understandable attitude. Since the nineteenth century, music has staked its special claim to aesthetic autonomy upon a capacity to bypass the explicit, verbal, and visual, and to generate abstract meaning from “pure” harmony and form. That was not the seventeenth-century view. Theirs was a logos culture, founded upon the Word, in which pure instrumental music had little value; full of sound, it might ultimately signify nothing. From this vantage, one might even conclude that, far from committing mercenary plagiarism, Maier improved Farmer’s music by discerning or even creating its latent meanings. The mechanisms of seventeenth-century wit implied more than humor, and mimesis provoked delight precisely because the text-music similitudes upon which it depended were grounded in deeper continuities. Explaining the devices of musica poetica, far from dulling delight, offered social occasions to refine it. Likewise, the “analogical harmonies” frequently posited between chymistry and theology, as Principe writes, [were] much more than a metaphor, allegory, or rhetorical conceit . . . The connective analogy . . . functions as a proof, transmitting the sure existence of one to the sure existence of the other . . . [This] expresses a keen difference between modern and early modern understandings of metaphors and analogies. The modern world considers such metaphors and analogies to be creations of the human mind . . . [For early modern chymists] they are neither arbitrary nor products of human imagination—they exist independently as real connections in the fabric of the world itself. They lie there hidden, waiting to be discovered. Music served as the ur-metaphor for harmony itself, hence the widespread conviction that rationally organized, sounding number could have a necessary, rather than contingent, connection to the words and ideas that it accompanied. (Now we consider them merely to be “expressed.”) From Maier’s London comes a rare testimony as to how idea and word became incarnate sound. In the preface to his Gradualia ac cantiones sacrae [. . .] liber primus (First Book of Sacred Songs and Gradual Motets, 1610), William Byrd reflected that: With Sacred words . . . nothing is suitable but a celestial harmony, insofar as we can attain to it. I have learned by experience, moreover, that a force most abstruse and recondite inheres in those very words such that, cogitating upon things divine, and diligently and seriously turning them over, by some means all the most fitting notes [numeri] hasten, as if of their own will, and freely offer themselves to a soul by no means inactive or unskilled. In a short space Byrd captures many of the ideas at which I have been grasping: words themselves possess inherent power. Fitting them to suitable music requires an act of cogitation in the recesses of mind and soul. Celestial harmony, though it ultimately evades musical sound, manifests itself as number. “Number” presumably refers not only to the proportions of individual intervals, but also to the extended expressive devices that Byrd used so beautifully. And yet he does not speak of himself as creator-composer. Having tuned mind and soul to heavenly harmony, he becomes the aeolian harp here below. It’s a weighty load to lay on Maier’s rickety fugues. And it would require extraordinary transhistorical empathy to experience Atalanta fuugiens’ music with ears so tuned. That world is gone. But we can still marvel at Maier’s books and the sheer possibility that Atalanta fugiens opened for readers. With an ambitious little print in hand, they could play musica in its many manifestations. Maier offered canons and cantilenas to tickle the ear, edify the educated mind, and fill the soul with harmonies surpassing mortal sense.

On the surface, it is a retooling of the story from Ovid’s Metamorphoses about a legendary race between a beautiful huntress named Atalanta and her suitor Hippomenes, who won their contest with the help of three golden apples that he received from the goddess of love, Venus. Its unabridged title reads: Atalanta fleeing, that is, new chymical emblems about the secrets of nature. Accommodated in part to the eyes and intellect, by means of figures cut in copper, and added mottos, Epigrams and notes, in part to the ears and to the restoration of the mind, by means of more or less 50 Musical Flights for three Voices, of which two should respond to one plain melody suitable for singing the couplets, not without [each other]; to be seen, read, reflected upon, understood, judged, sung and heard with singular pleasure. This is followed by the official designations of the author, Michael Maier (“Count of the Imperial Consistory, Doctor of Medicine, Knight Exemplus, Etc.”), as well as the book’s publication information (“Oppenheim from the press of Hieronymus Gallerus, at the expense of Johann Theodor de Bry, 1618”). Atalanta fugiens is actually a fusion of three different subject areas—secular vocal music, emblematics, and alchemy—showcased in a tour de force of early modern print technologies. Essentially, Maier’s “new chymical emblems about the secrets of nature” are multimedia units of information formatted as three interlocking pieces: fugue, emblem, and discourse. There are fifty emblems to engage the reader’s “eyes and intellect,” paired with fifty musical fugues (“flights”) that engage the ears. Each fugue-emblem set is completed by a two-page discourse (“notes”) that provides context and relevant bibliographic information. Various vignettes frame the title’s text, depicting scenes from Ovid’s Metamorphoses where Venus tells her lover Adonis about Atalanta’s story. With its interplay of text and image, Atalanta fugiens’ title page is a rich and immersive summary of the book. Tara Nummedal presents an elegant anatomy of Atalanta fugiens in this volume, examining how the reader’s sensory experience of Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book functions as a tool to engage with its various allegorical layers in order to reach the inner alchemical meanings it embodies. Yet Atalanta fugiens deviates from early modern emblem book norms, most obviously with Maier’s full-scale integration of music. This is atypical of the genre. While emblem books from the Low Countries containing musical elements exist, such inclusions are sporadic and unsystematic. In contrast, the vocal scores in Atalanta fugiens are purposive. They follow the emblem’s tripartite motto-image-epigram structure, but where an image would conventionally be inserted between the textual elements, Maier fits a musical score for three voices: “Atalanta fleeing” [Atalanta fugiens], “Hippomenes following” [Hippomenes sequens], and the “Delaying Apple” [Pomum morans]. Maier in effect creates a sonic emblem that mirrors its visual counterpart, presented in a double-page layout with text set in two languages (German and Latin) in two different type styles, their contrasting fonts lending the musical emblems an elegant aesthetic (fig. 1). List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography Figure 1 But why did Maier create a musical alchemical emblem book? This essay advances a hypothesis: that Maier engineered Atalanta fugiens to both conceal and reveal two books in one, creating a virtuoso work of steganography whereby a magic square is hidden in plain sight. Steganography is a form of secret writing that conceals a message or information in a cover text. A magic square is the term for a mathematical puzzle that is comprised of a square grid of numbered cells whose rows, columns, and diagonals all add up to the same value. I argue that Maier plays with the inherent duality that defines the emblem itself—the allegorical art of concealing and revealing information—to create a book that can be read as fifty sequential musical emblems, or reshuffled as a magic square. Reading Atalanta fugiens as a mathematical puzzle becomes a conceptual exercise in the creation of new combinations of “chymical emblems” and “musical flights” for exploring the secrets of nature, a leitmotif highlighted in Maier’s title, the Preface to the Reader [Praefatio ad lectorem], and in the header for each of the fifty emblems, “About the Secrets of Nature” [De secretis naturae]. From the standpoint of the steganography hypothesis, I posit that the shift from the book’s visible version to a hidden puzzle is predicated upon the reader’s detecting and then solving clues that Maier has embedded in the design of the emblems. In chasing Atalanta, the reader becomes a hunter and collector of clues that Maier has dispersed throughout the emblems. In sorting out and evaluating these clues, interpretation and contemplation turn into an interactive game based on the transmutation of the number of emblems from fifty to forty-nine that occurs with uncovering the magic square. In particular, Emblems 1, 2, and 26 are understood to contain clues in their textual elements that are split up and then rejoined through recognition of their literary source, providing the reader with keys to discovering the hidden puzzle, i.e., the magic square. These three emblems are also interconnected by a reference in Atalanta fugiens’ title that can be interpreted to indicate a shift in the total number of musical emblems from fifty to forty-nine, which is integral to the magic square-encipherment hypothesis. The title provides a detailed outline of the fifty musical fugues in Atalanta fugiens, a number that is borne out by the book’s contents. Yet at the same time, Maier seems to equivocate about this total, using the phrase “more or less” [plus minus] as part of his enumeration. Why? The following examination of the beginning, middle, and end points of Atalanta fugiens postulates the hidden presence of a magic square as a possible explanation. This essay considers Atalanta fugiens as a steganographic work from the following angles: 1) through the identification of binaries that I refer to as “doubling,” which facilitates exploration of a trope that Maier uses in Atalanta fugiens to express notions of transformation from one thing/state into another, and to signal clues in halved textual elements whose hidden meaning emerges when they are rejoined; and 2) as a structural examination of how doubling works in the design of Emblems 1, 2, 26, and 50, whose assessment from this standpoint demonstrates how we can think about Maier’s emblems in terms of cover text and ciphertext. The Double Lion Think of an emblem that you see on a printed page (its whole motto-image-epigram package) as akin to the outer shell of a nut, which encases its kernel. Similarly, an emblem’s message is encased in its outer form (i.e., its textual and graphic representation upon the page), and the reader apprehends its hidden inner message through contemplation of the interplay between word and image, essentially peeling away this allegorical wrapper to reach the innermost kernel of meaning. Contemplation awakens insight from which knowledge takes root and grows. Thus, an emblem both conceals and reveals its inner meaning to the reader, whose ability to apprehend it also lies in recognizing the literary allusions that the author has used in its construction. Maier plays with this mode of concealing and revealing information through doubling, which functions as a flexible allegorical conceit in Atalanta fugiens. Doubling, as used here, refers to Maier’s simultaneous communication of both the inner and outer natures of a thing or idea. Doubling aligns with other early modern techniques of concealment such as dispersion, Decknamen, syncope, and parathesis, employed in alchemical texts and images to protect secret knowledge from ignorant or unworthy eyes. Furthermore, doubling in Atalanta fugiens riffs on the idea of transformation that structures the book itself. The reader in fact encounters doubling in the very first page of Atalanta fugiens, which is a single leaf imprinted with the title page on one side, and the Author’s Epigram [Epigramma authoris] on the other. Here, the materiality of the book functions as a dual-sided delivery system of information that communicates both depictions and descriptions of Atalanta fugiens’ alchemical interface with Ovid’s Atalanta story. The following examination of the relationship between Maier’s title page and the Author’s Epigram provides a useful template for identifying and explicating the hermeneutics of doubling in Atalanta fugiens. To begin with, there are essentially two tandem versions of the Atalanta story. Ovid’s tale lends the framework for Maier’s alchemical adaptation, with themes around the transformation of states and natures serving as connective tissue between the two authors. In Atalanta fugiens, the characters of Atalanta and Hippomenes represent two of the three principal alchemical elements, mercury and sulfur, and in the context of this personification perhaps Maier implies that the golden apple is the third element, salt. The title page (fig. 2) illustrates specific episodes of their story, which Maier highlights in the “Author’s Epigram,” and both title and epigram draw attention to the union and transformation of Atalanta/mercury and Hippomenes/sulfur. The lovers’ profane embrace in Cybele’s temple is captured in the bottom right-hand vignette of the title page, their subsequent transformation into lions embodied in the illustration of the two beasts that pace between the temple scene and the race. The “Author’s Epigram” elaborates on this, describing Atalanta and Hippomenes’ change of state as a “re-clothing” into lion skins, an action that makes their bodies become red, and an allusion to the perfection of alchemical matter. With Maiertitle page’s literary shift away from an Ovidian referent, the two lovers’ copulation in Cybele’s temple morphs into the commingling of mercury and sulfur in an alchemical retort during the process of making the philosophers’ stone. Figure 2 Add to Collection The concluding verse of the Author’s Epigram marks the medical arts as fundamental to Maier’s alchemical program: “Whatever the world [holds] of wealth, or Medicine holds of health, / the double Lion is able to supply all in abundance.” The “double lion” adds yet another layer of meaning to the Atalanta/mercury Hippomenes/sulfur transformation trope. Their alchemical union will produce the philosophers’ stone, the means to attain wealth and health, and a subtle irenic subtext can be discerned in Maier’s intimation of the riches that transmutational alchemy provides the worthy. Thus, the Garden of the Hesperides, our entrance into Atalanta fugiens, becomes a metonym for the Garden of Eden where the expulsion of Adam and Eve elides with the punishment of Atalanta and Hippomenes. The golden apple links the Tree of Life in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22–24 to the alchemical elixir of life given biblical testimony in Revelation 22:1–2, wherein its curative properties, fed by the crystal clear waters of the river that flows from the throne of God, are an archetype for Eden restored. Maier’s reference to wealth and health in the Author’s Epigram receives full articulation in Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26, the emblem dedicated to those who seek Wisdom (fig. 3). Figure 3 Add to Collection She appears in Emblem 26 as a crowned female holding in each hand a banderole featuring excerpts from Proverbs 3:16—one is inscribed “Length of days and health” [Longitudo dierum et sanitas], and the other “Glory and endless wealth” [Gloria ac divitiae infinitae]. Wisdom therefore awaits the reader in the middle of Atalanta fugiens as an alchemical guide for “someone” who approaches her “with reason and hand” [ratione manúque], the bodily instruments of experimental practice. Otherwise we are left on the outside, like the young man in Emblem 27 who stands stuck in the ground before the locked gate that bars his entry into the Rose Garden of wisdom, handicapped, having no feet to support him and without the use of his hands. With Atalanta and Hippomenes as Decknamen for mercury and sulfur, Maier’s musical emblem book scripts a rich exploration into the investigation of the secrets of nature through alchemy, understood by contemporaries as the art of material separations and transformations by fire. Early modern alchemy had medico-pharmaceutical and industrial applications. It was also a system of investigation that explored nature’s secrets through chymical processes of transmutation, often centered around chrysopoea (gold-making), a mode of alchemical practice lauded (often by the alchemist him- or herself) as a noble and divinely sanctioned endeavor. Philosophical gold was believed achievable through the successful completion of a series of chymical processes involving separation of pure and impure parts in the perfection of matter. This would ultimately produce the universal cure to eradicate human disease and prolong life, affecting a return to prelapsarian perfection. The “true” alchemist held to this altruism in order that he or she be judged apart from the base desire for material gain that was the hallmark of the charlatan. So, could Atalanta fugiens be designed around a network of clues that conceals a mathematical puzzle? Maier himself draws attention to the existence of “secret signs” [arcanas . . . notas] in the Author’s Epigram, which goes on to state: “I bear these offerings [i.e., the emblems] to the senses, so that the intellect, through these enticements, might seize the precious things that lie hidden.” The following case study examines points of connectivity among Emblems 1, 2, 26, and 50 through doubling, and demonstrates how this allegorical conceit also functions as encipherment. Secret Signs Figure 4 Add to Collection In Emblem 1, we see great swirls of air assuming the bodily form of a god-like man, or vice versa, and an unborn child carried in his belly (fig. 4). This image is accompanied by the motto, “The wind carried him in his belly.” The epigram reads, If the embryo, which is enclosed in the windy belly of BOREAS, if once he will be born living into this light; Then this one all the labors of the Heroes is able to surpass in art, hand, strong body, mind. Let that one not be a Coeso for you, nor a useless miscarriage, not an Agrippa, but offspring from a good star. The first concept that the reader encounters upon turning to Emblem 1 is “embryo.” It is expressed graphically in the emblem as the unborn child in the belly of Boreas, god of the North Wind, and as the first written word in the Latin epigram and the lyrics of the accompanying fugue. In Emblem 1, “embryo” represents the conception of the Great Work, i.e., making the philosophers’ stone. Figure 5 Add to Collection In Emblem 2, we see a child suckling the teat of a woman whose body is formed like a globe; she is flanked by a goat nursing an infant, and a wolf nursing two other infants (fig. 5). This is accompanied by the motto, “His nurse is the earth.” The epigram reads, Romulus is said to have pressed the shaggy teats of a she-wolf, but Jupiter those of a she-goat, and that there is confidence in the deeds: What is strange, if we hold that the EARTH has nursed with her own milk the viscera of the WISEMEN’S tender OFFSPRING? If a little tiny beast fed such great Heroes, HOW GREAT will he be, whose NURSE is the TERRESTRIAL RING? Emblem 2 presents the idea of inception through the nourishment of the philosophical child that has been brought into being. Here, mother’s milk is the quintessential life-giving fluid, a transmission of substance and strength that flows from mother to child, allegorized in three maternalistic representations: a female with a body shaped like the earth (identified as “the nurse” in the motto), the “she-goat” Amalthea who nurses Jupiter the sky god, and the wolf who nurses the legendary twins Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome and sons of Mars. Together, Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 represent male and female qualities that comprise the philosophers’ stone. Compare Emblems Male and Female Doubling Collection Add to Emblem Collections The reader who is familiar with core alchemical texts will immediately recognize something familiar about the mottos in Emblem 1 and Emblem 2, respectively: “the wind carried him in his belly” and “his nurse is the earth.” These mottos in fact together form the second part of a precept from the Tabula smaragdina (Emerald Tablet), held to be authored by Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient Egyptian magus-king-philosopher: “Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon. The wind carried it in its belly, the Earth is its nurse.” Significantly, Atalanta fugiens commences with reference to a text considered by Maier and his contemporaries as one of the most venerable authorities on the secrets of transmutation in the alchemical corpus. Based on the textual connection between these two mottos, Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 combine to form a dual-sided introduction to Atalanta fugiens. Their conflation constitutes a kind of doubling whereby two things, or texts, or concepts, merge into a single entity, just as a coin is a single object with two distinct faces. The conflation of texts in the mottos of Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 relates to the dual-sided doubling embodied in the single leaf that bears the title page on its front and the Author’s Epigram on its back. We also see this in Maier’s reference to the double lion in the Author’s Epigram, where, significantly, Maier does not use the Latin plural form of lion in his allegorization of the union of Atalanta/mercury and Hippomenes/sulfur, even though a male and a female lion are depicted as two entities in the title page. Maier’s pointed reference to “the double lion” as Leo geminus intends for the reader to understand this alchemical transformation as producing a new state of matter from the combination of two different qualities. The mottos in Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 similarly reflect the combination of two things into one entity. This notion of doubling in Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 is also reinforced by the Latin grammar of the mottos themselves, which in Emblem 1 is in the perfect indicative (a tense that provides the “back story,” if you will), while the motto in Emblem 2 is given in the present indicative. In this way, they also express two states of time: past and present. Notably, the motto in Emblem 3 signals a change in tone, using the imperative to express command. This is appropriate because Emblem 3 marks the start of Maier’s presentation of alchemical arts in Atalanta fugiens with its allegorical representation of calcination, the first alchemical stage in the process for making the philosophers’ stone. Most of Maier’s subsequent mottos also use the imperative. In contrast, Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 are describing a state of nature as opposed to a technology. Emblem 26 depicts the personification of Wisdom [sapientia] as a crowned female standing in the middle of a path, holding an inscribed ribbon-like banderole in each of her hands (fig. 3). The motto states, “The fruit of human wisdom is the Wood of life.” The epigram reads, There is no greater wisdom in human affairs, than that by which wealth and a healthy life come. The right hand of this [wisdom] holds a healthy lifespan of spacious time, the left moreover conceals heaps of riches. If someone should with reason and hand approach her, for him the fruit of life will be in her, as though a tree. The reader finds Wisdom in the middle of Atalanta fugiens. Wisdom is personified in Emblem 26 as female, based on the feminine gender of the noun in both Hebrew and Latin throughout Proverbs. She is attired in a Minerva-esque muscle cuirass and a three-pointed crown, and she stands in the middle of a pathway in between beams of celestial light and a tree. The banderole in her right (upturned) hand connects to this empyrean light, while the one in her left (downturned) hand joins the roots of the tree beside her, an evocation of the Tree of Life. Emblem 26 is another example of an emblem that features a split text whose pieces rejoin upon recognition of its literary source. However, Maier’s presentation of a halved text in Emblem 26 differs from how he breaks up Emblem 1 and Emblem 2, in which the excerpted halves of a precept from a seminal alchemical text are reconstituted by reading across two mottos that are physically separated within the book. Conversely, the text in Emblem 26 is divided between two banderoles that are depicted within a single page, united through the figure of Wisdom. Figure 6 Maier features musical doubling in Fugue 26 (fig. 6). The interval of imitation of the two canonic voices (Atalanta and Hippomenes) in Fugue 26 is the double octave, stated as such in its header with the reference “8 duplici.” Fugue 26 is among the nine unison or octave canons in Atalanta fugiens, and Maier gives the same instructions in Fugue 47 (also a double octave). After the unison, the octave is the most perfect consonance, and two octaves is the greatest interval of imitation between the canonic voices of Atalanta and Hippomenes in the book. In Fugue 26, Atalanta is a high soprano while Hippomenes is scored as a bass, and the Delaying Apple is a tenor. The header for Fugue 26 contains some unusual elements. It reads in its entirely: “gFUGA XXII. in 8. duplici; infrà” [gFugue 22, 2 octaves below]. As such, it has two typographical infelicities: the letter “g” that is attached to the word “FUGA,” and the inaccurate Roman numeral that should read XXVI instead of XXII. The extra “g” might relate to the fact that Fugue 26 is based on Farmer’s canon 7. Maier transposes the whole piece up a fourth (this is true for all of Farmer’s music in Atalanta fugiens), hence the Apple melody starts on D and ends on G. Moreover, “g” is the seventh letter in the alphabet, and its placement in the header might be a conceit on Maier’s part in reference to the original musical source. The erroneous Roman numeral in Fugue 26 is puzzling, yet it is not the only typographical error in Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26. There is another typo in the header on page 115 (i.e., the second of the two-page Discourse 26), which reads “YXVI” (which is not a valid Roman numeral) instead of “XXVI.” Misnumbering in Atalanta fugiens is not in and of itself unusual; printers can make mistakes. However, it is noteworthy that 26 contains more misprints in its headers than any other musical emblem in Atalanta fugiens, and it is the only instance in the book where the header of a fugue contains an extra letter as well as an incorrect Roman numeral. Intentional or otherwise, the typos in the headers of Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26 draw attention, as does its overall emphasis on wisdom, communicated through numerous scriptural references that structure this emblem. The source of Emblem 26’s motto is Proverbs 3:18, while Maier’s reference therein to the “Wood of life” signposts the centrality of medicine in this emblem. Maier’s lignum vitae in Emblem 26 is the counterpart to the arbor vitae, the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, which bears fruit that gives eternal life. The motif of wealth and health introduced in the Author’s Epigram is thus linked to Epigram 26 by its references to Proverbs 3:16 and 18, verses that declare the blessedness of those who seek Wisdom, and the honor and riches that are bestowed upon those who find her. Discourse 26 features additional scriptural citations in both its text and marginalia related to the theme of wisdom. Here, Maier asserts that Wisdom is the embodiment of “the true knowledge of Chymistry together with practice,” and that all good things come from the labor of her hands. Alchemical praxis brings spiritual and earthly reward. Discourse 26 concludes by saying that the Tree of Life shows the way to eternal life while bearing wholesome fruit to be used in the temporal world, for without wealth and health, “a man even living is dead.” Figure 7 Add to Collection Emblem 50 shows a shallow grave in which a woman lies bound in the coils of a dragon (fig. 7). A ruined archway frames this scene, and opposite this stands a two-tiered coliseum whose entryways appear to be bricked up. Two obelisks are in the distance. The motto states, “A dragon slays a woman, and she him, and at the same time they are poured over with blood.” The epigram reads, Let a deep grave be dug for a poisonous Dragon, and let a woman be bound to him well by his own coil: While that one plucks the joys of the marital bed, she is dying, and let the Dragon be covered together with her in earth. Hence his body is given to death and is tinged with gore: This is the true path of your work. The emblem that draws Atalanta fugiens to a close appropriately relates to tincture, the final alchemical stage in producing the philosophers’ stone. This is signaled in the concluding verse of Emblem 50's epigram: “Hence his body is given to death and is tinged with gore: This is the true path of your work.” Tincture is the culmination of the alchemist’s work, it embodies the idea of imbuing or permeating purified matter with color. The motto’s source is a passage from Turba philosophorum (Crowd of Philosophers) that describes the union of opposites by the binding of the dragon with a woman put to death for killing her husbands; her intestines are full of poison, which is a substance of transformation. The Turba philosophorum goes on to describe how, in the grave, the dragon’s body mixes with the woman’s and gradually turns to blood, which the philosophers desiccate in the sun: “Then the poison appears, and what is hidden takes shape.” In Emblem 50, doubling is used to express the binding and the union of opposites, depicted in the emblem’s image by the woman lying bound in the coils of a dragon where they look to be on the brink of a kiss, an intimate commingling of two bodies. Maier concludes Atalanta fugiens with a sentence in Discourse 50 that adjures the “Sons of learning” to understand the meaning of the woman and the dragon, which Maier says he has revealed perhaps too openly, to share in these revelations about “the secrets of almost the whole art” undertaken for the glory of God. With this final emblem, the conceit of doubling brings full circle the themes of birth, death, and renewal. Cipher and Key Techniques of concealment were a mainstay of the early modern age of mass communication. Handwritten codes and ciphers were a common feature of official and private correspondence even as printed literature about cryptography broadcasted the art of secret communication to a public readership. Cryptography converts a message into unintelligible text by means of ciphers or code. Steganography conceals a message in plain sight, which can be done in diverse ways: from using a grille overlaid atop a text, to using alphabet letters as in Francis Bacon’s biliteral cipher. Maier used emblems. A cipher can be created using a variety of systems: words, numbers, sound, and gesture, among other things. From this perspective, Maier’s fragmentation of texts in Emblems 1, 2, and 26 is thought provoking. Are there causal factors associated with this physical division of the mottos in Emblem 1 and Emblem 2? The conflation of these two mottos into one unit of information connotes a numerical shift in the total number of musical emblems from fifty to forty-nine, which would invest a deeper meaning to Maier’s “more or less” [plus minus] reference in the title. Loren Ludwig has established that Maier did not in fact compose forty of the fifty fugues, but used a compilation of forty choral exercises from Diuers & sundry waies of two parts in one (1591) by the English composer John Farmer. On the one hand, Fugues 42 and 43 are both taken from Farmer’s canon 19, which provides two options for the way the parts can be ordered. Thus, Maier’s plus minus reference may just be signaling that two of the fugues are really the same fugue. On the other hand, this does not address why Maier came up with additional fugues to total fifty musical emblems. Why not just stick to the forty canons from Sundry waies? Maier’s ambiguous plus minus phrase in Atalanta fugiens’ title may or may not indicate a shift in the total number of musical fugues. Arguably, the conflation of Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 does. Figure 8 The numerical shift from fifty to forty-nine caused by merging the mottos of Emblem 1 and Emblem 2 is characteristic of encryption. This action evokes the technology of the cipher wheel or disk, a form of encoding a message using a simple but powerful system of alphanumeric substitution, first formulated by Leon Battista Alberti in 1467. Early modern cryptography treatises demonstrate its mechanics using an interactive tool called the volvelle (a paper construction with moving parts), in which one circle turns on top of another, and each turn of the disk creates a new cipher alphabet (fig. 8). The cryptographic work De furtivis literarum notis (On the Hidden Meaning of Letters, 1563) by Giambattista della Porta features ornate cipher disk volvelles, and in his exposition of how they work della Porta also details their conversion into tables, and vice versa. The combinatorics that emerges with the conflation of Emblems 1 and 2 shifts the number of musical emblems from fifty to forty-nine, renumbering Emblems 1 and 2 into 1; Emblem 3 into 2, Emblem 4 into 3, etc. Reconfiguring Emblems 1—8 1 Emblems 1 and 2 2 Emblem 3 3 Emblem 4 4 Emblem 5 5 Emblems 5 6 Emblem 6 7 Emblem 7 8 Emblem 8 But what is the point of this? Wisdom may provide the key: in both cases Emblem 26/25 retains its place in the overall order as the central emblem. Since this leaves a sequence of 49 = 7 x 7 emblems, Atalanta fugiens can be rearranged into a 7 x 7 magic square, for which Maier may have turned to Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim’s De occulta philosophia (On Hidden Philosophy, 1533) as a source. Agrippa von Nettesheim tabulates magic squares for each of the seven planets, and the 7 x 7 table is assigned to Venus. Agrippa’s Venus Magic Square There is compelling evidence within Atalanta fugiens for positing an association with Agrippa von Nettesheim’s 7 x 7 Venus magic square. The goddess Venus is a significant character in Atalanta fugiens. She asserts a prominent visual presence in Maier’s title page while her voice is implied therein as the narrator of the Atalanta story. Maier’s Preface to the Reader tangibly connects Venus to the physical book through his reference to the most abstruse chymical secrets that are engraved in Venus or copper, an allusion to copper as Venus’ metallic element as well as to the material used to produce the emblems’ etchings. Transformation is more than a theme in Atalanta fugiens; it is embedded in the DNA of the book itself. From this perspective, with the emblems’ transmutation of numbers from fifty to forty-nine, the book morphs into a magic square associated with Venus, who is also the consort of Vulcan, god of forge and of the alchemist’s tool of transformation: fire. By definition, a magic square is an n x n array of numbers (from 1 to n2) whose rows, columns, and two diagonals sum to the magic number μ, defined as n(n2 + 1) / 2. In a 7 x 7 magic square, the numbers 1 through 49 must be ordered in such a way that every row, column, and diagonal sums up to the magic number 175. The number of possible 7 x 7 magic squares has yet to be enumerated. However, the focus here is on the 7 x 7 Venus magic square from Agrippa von Nettesheim, which has 25 at its center. The center number is a defining property of the magic square and it is always found by dividing its magic number (which in a 7 x 7 magic square is 175) by its dimension (in this case 7), which here calculates to 25. Any 7 x 7 array that satisfies these conditions qualifies as a magic square. Figure 9 The Venus magic square is further distinguished in the magic square family for being a regular 7 x 7 magic square—Albrecht Dürer’s print Melencolia I depicts a famous example of a regular 4 x 4 magic square (fig. 9). The properties of the Venus magic square follow these rules: The center is 25 because it is the center itself and is therefore equidistant of distance 0. Alternatively, one could look at the center row: it has seven numbers in it, and by regularity the first and last add up to 50, the second and sixth add up to 50, and the third and fifth add up to 50. Since we know the entire row adds up to 175, we know the center number is 25. 13 + 37 = 50 31 + 19 = 50 7 + 43 = 50 In this regular magic square, any two rows (or columns) that are equidistant from the center row (or column) can be exchanged, and the magic square will still be magic. Exchanging two columns does not change the sum total of any of the columns, because this exchange does not change any of the numbers. This exchange also does not change the sum total of any of the rows because it only changes the order of the numbers but not the numbers themselves. This exchange also does not change the sum total of the diagonals. Such an exchange swaps two cells along each diagonal; however, due to the regularity of the square, the sum of any two such cells is 50, and thus swapping them does not change the total sum. Note: for a general magic square, if you exchanged such rows equidistant from the center row and also the corresponding columns, you would preserve the magic squareness property. What is stated here about the Venus magic square is that its regularity transfers a stronger kind of symmetry. Any magic square can be flipped or rotated, and that will preserve its magic squareness. As a result, a magic square can undergo simple rotation or diametric reflection. The Venus magic square has an extra property in part because it has 25 in its center, and because of regularity, it is a mathematical necessity that wisdom (26/25) be in the center of Maier’s puzzle. It is an open mathematical question as to whether or not the Venus magic square is unique given that the number of unique regular 7 x 7 magic squares is unknown. However, if Maier did in fact purpose-build Atalanta fugiens around a hidden 7 x 7 magic square, having a total number of forty musical emblems as per Farmer would not work. As a magic square, Atalanta fugiens presents a delightful inversion of encipherment, as its visible sequence of 1–50 musical emblems actually constitutes the scrambled text for the concealed mathematical puzzle, which reorders them according to the algorithm of the magic square, and through its rotations. In this way, Maier hides the Venus magic square in plain sight. Pathways Magic squares are recreational, playful, and creative. If Atalanta fugiens is a game, how do we play it? Perhaps figuring this out is part of the hunt for “secret signs” that Maier alludes to in the Author’s Epigram. If we reorder Atalanta fugiens into the Venus magic square as per Agrippa von Nettesheim, then Emblems 1, 2, 26, and 50 group together to form its center column. Read vertically, these emblems retain their position in the Venus magic square as the beginning, middle, and end of Atalanta fugiens. 22. Emblem 23 47. Emblem 48 16. Emblem 17 41. Emblem 42 10.

Emblem 29 Compare Emblems Venus Square Collection Add to Emblem Collections Within the parameters of the Venus magic square hypothesis, Emblem 17 and Emblem 42 are brought together along the first row according to this magic square’s algorithm. Compare Emblems Fours Collection Add to Emblem Collections The motto in Emblem 17 reads, “The fourfold circuit rules this work of fire,” and its epigram assigns the four fiery spheres depicted in the image to Vulcan, Mercury, Luna, and Apollo. The motto in Emblem 42 lists four requirements for chymical investigation: Nature as a guide, together with reason, experiment, and reading. In Discourse 42, Maier relates these four attributes to the four wheels of the Philosophic chariot. From this perspective, we can extrapolate a connection between the four fiery spheres in Emblem 17 and the four-wheeled chariot in Emblem 42 based on their intertextuality. The example of such a plausible pairing between Emblems 17/16 and 42/41 also demonstrates how information that is dispersed in the 1–50 emblem sequence of Atalanta fugiens can be reconstituted in emblems’ reconfiguration in the Venus magic square. Another hypothetical grouping is discernible along the third row of the Venus magic square, which can be read from left to right or right to left, based on reduplicated features among four emblems. Compare Emblems Swimming, Dragons, and Mountain Collection Add to Emblem Collections What other kinds of new pairings can be created in following the Venus magic square’s algorithm? Do pairings exist along orthogonals? How does the Venus magic square’s rotation reconfigure pairings? How might new combinations be established in reshuffling the fugues? (See essay by Eric Bianchi.) A hidden magic square in Atalanta fugiens contains the potential to form and reform the reader’s investigation into the secrets of nature in its generation of a myriad of pathways through Maier’s puzzle. Pathways run through the 1–50 sequence of emblems in Atalanta fugiens. Maier’s alchemical path to wisdom starts in Emblem 1, where Boreas lifts his billowy right hand to reveal the point of entry: a ruined castle gateway composed of the remains of two towers that flank an open portal, an architectural feature fitted at the juncture of earth, water, and sky. In Emblem 26, Wisdom stands in the middle of a path, in the middle of the book, as the fulcrum between its visible and hidden versions. The path ends in Emblem 50 where the woman and dragon lie entwined in an open grave, the inversion of the windy womb of Boreas described in Emblem 1. Compare Emblems Pathway Collection Add to Emblem Collections All fifty emblems interconnect to communicate a storyline around the creation of the philosophers’ stone, the panacea that was the goal of transmutational alchemy. Yet Maier’s allegorical exposition of alchemical arts does not unfold procedurally. This storyline is broken up with pieces scattered across Atalanta fugiens. Connectivity emerges through the reoccurrence of specific objects in certain emblems and through identification of alchemical processes, signposted in the emblems by depictions of material things and activities. For example, in Emblem 6 a husbandman [ruricola] scatters gold coins like a shower of seeds from a bowl he cradles in one arm; similar gold coins appear in Emblem 18 piled in a large two-handled bowl before a roaring furnace tended by a craftsman. Compare Emblems Gold Coins Collection Add to Emblem Collections Atalanta fugiens also presents a cast of characters, some of whom recur in different emblems (another atypical feature of the early modern emblem book genre). Emblem 23 depicts the mythological birth of Athena from Zeus’ head; behind this scene, a statue-like figure with a radiant light around his head stands on a pedestal, passively holding a bow with a quiver at his side; nearby, Sol lies with Venus amid a rainfall of gold. We next see this radiant figure in Emblem 25, prowling along a shoreline with his bow drawn and nocked with an arrow; a nearby swimmer propels himself through the water, his form and action distinctly resembling the swimming king featured in Emblem 31. Compare Emblems Radiant Figure and Swimming King Collection Add to Emblem Collections One man consistently appears throughout the book, a kind of main character, distinguished from others by his particular style of classicizing attire and by the fact that he is always depicted doing a specific action with his hands. Interestingly, this man resembles the portrait of Maier himself on page 11 of certain 1618 copies of Atalanta fugiens. (See essay by Stephen Tabor.) He imparts an impression of being middle-aged based on his body type and chiseled facial features. He is well-groomed, mustachioed and bearded with a close-cropped hairstyle. He wears a muscle cuirass and pteruges (strips of leather hanging from either the shoulders or waist as a skirt), and on occasion he sports a cloak. His boots reach mid-calf, and while they vary in design (sometimes plain, sometimes striped) they are characterized by being turned over at the top with a centrally placed decorative ornament. The reader first encounters him in Emblem 4 where he stands at the edge of a path, proffering the “cup of love” to the “brother” and “sister” who embrace in its middle. In Emblem 8, he raises a “fiery” sword above a giant egg. In Emblem 9, he is the “old man” [senex] seated inside the “bedewed house” [rorida domo] who plucks a gold apple from a tree therein with his right hand and is about to bite into another apple that he holds in his left. All of these actions relate to alchemical processes, a point that applies to the other emblems in which he appears. Compare Emblems Bearded Man Collection Add to Emblem Collections The theme of Emblem 4 is the alchemical union of opposite elements between the hot-and-dry “brother” and the cold-and-moist “sister.” The egg in Emblem 8 symbolizes an alchemical retort. The tree inside the “bedewed house” in Emblem 9 evokes an alchemical substance known as the Tree of Diana. Other emblems represent alchemical processes and equipment: the subject of Emblem 3 is calcination; Emblem 17 can be understood as an allegorization of sublimation; and Emblem 28 represents a furnace type known as the vapor bath [balneum roris]. Discourse 7 characterizes “the mountain top” featured in the emblem as an alembic, and Discourse 34 makes further reference to mountains and mountain tops as symbolic representations of curcurbits and alembics. Atalanta fugiens is thus an allegorical laboratory where this Maier-like character as alchemist undertakes the Great Work of making the philosophers’ stone. Compare Emblems Alchemical Process Collection Add to Emblem Collections Conclusion In mythology, the dragon is the custodian of treasure, and this is Ladon’s role in the Garden of the Hesperides. He is depicted in the title page directly above Atalanta, who is rendered in the act of picking up a golden apple during her race with Hippomenes. The Latin block text of the title itself separates the dragon and the woman, and what is divided in the title page becomes rejoined in Emblem 50. Whether by chance or design, the Arabic numeral “50” in the title lies halfway between Ladon and Atalanta—and it is the centermost point in the title page itself. If Maier indeed constructed Atalanta fugiens as a game, then this feature of the book disappears with its reissue in 1687. Published sixty-five years after Maier’s death, and retitled as Secretioris naturae secretorum scrutinium chymicum (The Chymical Investigation of the Most Secret Nature of Secrets), this edition omits the title page from Atalanta fugiens as well as its music, excisions that completely change how the book is read. This in fact creates two distinctly different versions of Maier’s emblem book. Moreover, the question of how a seventeenth-century reader might have experienced Maier’s work is immediately complicated by numerous contemporary variants, presenting a constellation of Atalanta-objects each with a different interface, illuminating whole new sets of possibilities for reading Atalanta fugiens. This essay presents a first step in evaluating the question of Atalanta fugiens’ encipherment, and what is intriguing about this perspective is the ambiguity that enables us to read Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book in this way. This turns the question into why we could, or should, read Atalanta fugiens as a work of steganography, as doing so allows us to build promising new narratives of interpretation. The implications of this hypothesis generate starting points for investigations into relationships between Atalanta fugiens, Lullian combinatorial arts, music, and the art of memory, and of an epistemology of playfulness in early modern intellectual culture around knowledge production and games. Given the diverse and extensive scholarship on Atalanta fugiens to date, perhaps one reason why this book has not as yet been studied as steganographic is because no one suspected it to be. A well-enciphered message is not just one that defies cracking, but also one that escapes notice. List of Illustrations Figure 1 Emblem 1, Atalanta fugiens. Figure 2 Frontispiece, Atalanta fugiens.

The literary genre of what has been called Hermetic Mythology, or, more recently, mythoalchemy, worked on the premise that the myths of Egyptian, Greek, and Latin antiquity were repositories of alchemical secrets, coded narratives of natural philosophy. Early signs of this could already be seen in late medieval alchemical works like the fourteenth-century Pretiosa margarita novella (New Pearl of Great Price) of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara, but it was to develop further following the Renaissance upsurge in interest in classical antiquity, finding its flowering in the alchemical emblem literature of Michael Maier. Maier promotes the alchemical interpretation of mythology early in his publishing career, introducing a discussion of the alchemical significance of Hieroglyphica Aegyptio-Graeca (Greco-Egyptian Hieroglyphs) in his first major publication, Arcana arcanissima (Most Secret Secrets, 1614). His conviction of the alchemical exegesis of ancient myth was to find its most vibrant visual and verbal expression several years later in his elaborate multimedia Atalanta fugiens (Atalanta fleeing, 1618). Opening with an introduction to the early history of mythoalchemy, this essay then concentrates on Maier’s mythoalchemical works, arguing that it is not the visually flamboyant Atalanta fugiens but rather the richly intertextual Arcana arcanissima that lies at the heart of Maier’s mytho-chymical project. List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography A Brief History of Mythoalchemy Learned alchemists had long been condemnatory of those who naively read alchemical literature in an overly literal way. Catholic practitioners at times explicitly advocated an interpretative approach that drew inspiration from the multiple levels of biblical exegesis of holy scripture. Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596), for example, was drawn to the exegetical techniques of Jewish Kabbalah, in the conviction that even the most banal-seeming passages in scripture held unexpected treasures concealed in their depths. Even though Luther had called for a return to the literal reading of scripture, this did not discourage Protestant alchemists like Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605) from theosophical speculations on multiple levels of alchemical, magical, and cabalistic reading of material. Others, while quick to reject the idolatrous paganism of classical mythology, argued that the tales of the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman gods held far more valuable secrets, hidden from the profane, not to be taken literally but plumbed to their depths for lessons: moral, ethical, philosophical, political, or in the case of some, alchemical. Although some ancient Greek alchemical texts are attributed to mythical figures (Hermes, Agathodaemon, and Isis), Greek alchemists, such as Zosimos of Panopolis, Olympiodoros, or Stephanos of Alexandria, do not seem to have shown much interest in incorporating references to classical mythology in their symbolic language, let alone alchemical interpretations of Egyptian or Greek mythical material. The first sign we have of such a notion is from the seventh-century CE Byzantine chronicler John of Antioch, who “evoked an alchemical interpretation of the Golden Fleece,” arguing that it was “a book written on parchment teaching the reader how to make gold through alchemy; which was the real motivation for the quest of the Argonauts.” This idea was sustained by the tenth-century lexicographer Suidas, who recorded that “the Golden fleece was not what the fable says of it, but a book written on a skin and which taught the manner of making gold by alchemy. That is why the ancients rightly called it ‘The Golden Fleece’ because of what it enabled one to achieve.” Sylvain Matton reports that something similar was repeated by the Greek scholar Archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica (c. 1115–1195/96), who adds that “[Alexandrou] Kharax himself says that the Golden Fleece is a treatise of chrysography written on parchment, for which reason, in the measure that it was a thing of considerable importance, the ship the Argo was constructed [for Jason and the Argonauts].” Although the encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais (1184/94–c.1264), compiler of the Speculum maius (Greater Mirror), numbered Virgil amongst the masters of Alchemy, the first medieval consideration of Greek mythology in a “sensus chymicus” [chymical sense]—with the idea that the transformations of men and animals in, for example, Ovid’s Metamorphoses and Virgil’s Georgics and Aeneid, could be seen as analogies for the transmutation of metals—is found in the fourteenth century. This work is Petrus Bonus of Ferrara’s Pretiosa margarita novella, a work predating the Genealogia deorum gentilium (Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles, 1360), the famous mythographical work of his compatriot Boccaccio (1313–1375). There Bonus writes of “a certain gold hidden in Ovid” [aurum in Ovidio occultatum], with reference to the tales of the shape-shifting sea-god Proteus; the petrifying Gorgon, Medusa; and the goddess Minerva; to Theseus and the Minotaur in his labyrinth; to Aeneas and the golden bough; to Jason, Medea, and the Golden Fleece. With the upsurge of interest in Greek and Roman antiquity during the Renaissance, classical mythology and the “poetic theology” of the “ancient theologians” Orpheus, Hesiod, and Homer came to be valued as repositories of the secrets of natural philosophy. At a time when the Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) expounded on the mysteries to be discovered in the Corpus hermeticum (Hermetic Corpus) and the works of Plato and the Neoplatonists, the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (1455–1536) composed an alchemical exegesis of two Labors of Hercules as part of his unpublished treatise De magia (On Magic). In 1515, Ficino’s friend Giovanni Aurelio Augurelli (1441–1524) gave an alchemical meaning to a number of classical myths, such as the love affairs of Mars and Venus, or the quest for the Golden Fleece, in his alchemical neo-Latin poem Chrysopoeia (The Art of Making Gold). Just over a decade later, in De auro (On Gold, 1527), Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola (1469–1533) compared accounts of Jason’s quest for the Golden Fleece from the third-century BCE Greek epic poem the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes, and the pseudepigraphic fourth- or sixth-century CE Argonautica orphica (Orphic Argonautica). His conclusion was that “Jason sailed to Colchis on the quest of the Argonauts to seize not the golden sheepskin of Phrygia, but a parchment of ram’s membrane on which the process of making gold was described.” Without a doubt, the tale of the Golden Fleece (Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.9–424) was one of the most popular mythoalchemical themes, with its vivid images of Jason ploughing the fire-breathing bulls and sowing the teeth of the dragon that guarded the fleece, each episode signifying “the practice of this Arte, daungers and perrills in this worke, the purging and preparing of the matters and substaunce of the medicine.” Around the mid-sixteenth century, alchemical works began to appear that dealt with mythological material in some depth, notable examples being two works by the Italian physician and alchemist Giovanni Bracesco (1482–1555): Il legno della vita (The Wood of Life, 1542) and La espositione di Geber (The Explanation of Geber, 1544). In the latter he explicitly writes of how Jupiter’s transformation into a shower of gold represents the distillation of philosophical gold; the transformation of Argos’ eyes into a peacock’s tail intimates of the color changes of philosophical sulfur; the petrifying gaze of Medusa means the fixation of the elixir; the fable of the phoenix, repeatedly reborn, signifies the multiplication of the elixir; the tale of Daedalus and Icarus represents the processes of putrefaction and distillation; while the flight of Atalanta, chased by Hippomenes, is the coagulation of quicksilver with sulfur. In response, the Mythologiae, sive explicationis fabularum libri X (Ten Books of Mythology, or the Explanations of Fables, 1568), of the prominent mythographer Natale Conti (1520–1582) dismisses the interpretations of Bracesco as aberrant, but notes that they are approved by numerous alchemists. By this time, however, there was a long tradition of alchemical allegorical tales, such as the Duenech Allegory and the Allegory of Merlin, and the disdain of mythographers and lexicographers did little to deflate the enthusiasm of alchemists. In fact, the first systematic and most extensive collection of mythoalchemy dates from the same period, in the Auriloquio (Golden Discourse) manuscript by Vincenzo Percolla (d. 1572), which deals with 209 alchemical interpretations of mythological themes. Arcana arcanissima (1614) And so we come to the work of Michael Maier (1568–1622), who studied philosophy and medicine at the university of Rostock from 1587 to 1591, obtained his Masters in Frankfurt in 1592, and then spent 1595 and 1596 in Padua, where he was apparently crowned poet laureate. He finally completed his doctorate in medicine in Basel, with graduation theses on epilepsy in 1596. In 1608 he moved to the Bohemian capital of Prague, where the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II was the magnet for all alchemists, cabalists, and magicians. He formally entered Rudolf’s service the following year, 1609, when he was 40 years old, as personal physician and imperial counsellor. Maier’s first publication, De medicina regia (On Royal Medicine, 1609), dates from that period. In that work he draws from medieval European authors Geber, Arnold of Villanova, and Hortulanus Anglicus, author of the well-known commentary on the Tabula smaragdina (Emerald Tablet) of Hermes Trismegistus. In April 1611 Maier left Rudolf’s Catholic court and went in search of a new patron, courting the favor of the Calvinist princes of Germany, eventually spending the next five years in England, in and around the court of James I (1566–1625). It is worth noting that Maier arrived shortly after the first performance of the English playwright Ben Jonson’s satire The Alchemist, complete with alchemical interpretations of the myth of the golden fleece, by the King’s Men in 1610. In The Alchemist we read, for instance, “I have a peece of Jasons fleece, too, Which was no other, than a book of alchemie, Writ in large sheepe-skin, a good fat ram-vellam,” of the fiery bulls as the alchemical furnace, the dragon as quicksilver, its teeth as mercury sublimate, and Jason’s helm as the alembic. Perhaps Jonson’s play stimulated Maier’s imagination. Maier’s first major work, Arcana arcanissima, hoc est, hieroglyphica Aegyptio-Graeca (Most Secret Secrets, that is, Greco-Egyptian Hieroglyphs, 1614), allegedly first published in London by Thomas Creede (f. 1593–1617), is certainly a venture into the relations between alchemy and mythology. As Maier makes his disapproval of the false claims of gold-making Alcumia and his favor of genuine iatrochemical chymia perfectly clear in this early publication, and was to repeat this distinction in later works, perhaps, strictly speaking, we should here be speaking of “mytho-chymia” rather than mythoalchemy. The figurative title page of Arcana arcanissima gives a clear sense of its subject matter (fig. 1). At the top we find the three central figures of the Egyptian myth of the dismemberment of Osiris by his brother Typhon, the pieces collected and reassembled by their sister Isis. At the bottom of the page we have three creatures associated with Egyptian mythology: the Ibis and Cynocephalus or baboon, both linked with the god Thoth, identified with Hermes in Greek mythology and Mercury in Latin; the third creature is the sacred bull Apis. Flanking the title we find two figures from Greek mythology: on the left, Hercules, and on the right, Dionysus. The three central figures of the Egyptian myth of the dismemberment of Osiris by his brother Typhon, the pieces collected and reassembled by their sister Isis Hercules figure above Dionysus figure above Three creatures associated with Egyptian mythology: the Ibis and Cynocephalus or baboon, both linked with the god Thoth, identified with Hermes in Greek mythology and Mercury in Latin Figure 1 The Arcana arcanissima is divided into six books, which give a clear sense of Maier’s conviction of the underlying message of ancient myth: 1) On the Hieroglyphical Egyptian Gods (Osiris, Isis, Mercury, Vulcan, Typhon, etc.) and the mythic activities and characters of singular creatures; 2) On the allegories of the Greeks, primarily golden, such as Jason’s golden fleece, the golden apples of the Hesperides; 3) On the fictitious, philosophical or Chymico-medical golden genealogy of gods and goddesses; 4) On festivals and holy occasions, games, instituted in honor of this science; 5) On the Labors of Hercules and their meanings in relation to the art of alchemy; 6) On alchemical interpretations of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Maier is careful to criticize paganism, and to emphasize Christ’s role as the true Savior Physician, but nevertheless emphasizes the value of the chymical secrets lying behind the myths. He repeatedly reminds his readers that these tales should not be taken as histories, but are instead hieroglyphs or allegories, that is, tales “concealing some deeper meaning, philosophical or moral, which must be withheld from those persons too ignorant or too impious to use it aright.” According to Maier, the Egyptian priests transmitted their knowledge of the Chymical Artifice in this way so as to only reveal it to the most worthy. In support of this multilayered reading, as a devout Lutheran he avoids mentioning Catholic fourfold exegesis of scripture, but discusses instead the accustomed fourfold reading of the works of Homer, with Hieroglyphical, Political, Poetical, and Grammatical levels of consideration. The ancient Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BCE) is also mentioned as one who spoke of almost all the classical gods as “elements of the macrocosm” (thereby tacitly renouncing a plurality of gods), with Saturn, for example, representing the Heavens or Form, and Rhea the Earth or Matter. Suidas’ belief that the Golden Fleece was a “book or membrane containing Chrysopoeia” is introduced into the argument. But the “Most Secret Secret” is that mythology is all about chymia, transmitted by means of hieroglyphical letters or pictures of animals, from the Egyptians to the Greeks, and the truest interpretation is that it all concerns the “Philosophical Medicine,” the “golden Medicine, acting as golden medicament of the body and spirit.” Maier introduces his reader to the four principle “Hieroglyphical Gods of the Egyptians,” namely Osiris or the Sun, and Isis or the Moon, as brother and sister; “Mercurius,” who joins with the Sun and Moon, as common to both; and finally, the “burning spirit,” Typhon (i.e., Set), not classed as a god, but as a malign demon, who chopped his twin brother Osiris into “most fine parts” [tenuissimas partes]. In addition to these four, Maier lists a decidedly Latin-sounding group of Egyptian deities: Vulcan (external fire), Pallas (Wisdom of Operating), Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Apollo, Pluto, and the rest. Elsewhere Maier introduces Horus as one of the most ancient gods, preceding a list of twelve Greco-Roman deities, six male and six female, with reference to the mythographer Natale Conti. Maier argues that the ancient poets wanted to show that “those Gods did not exist, except as fictitious [and] imaginary, but were symbols and emblems, some for the eye, others for the mind, hidden to the vulgar, but known to themselves.” Maier is most interested in the “Chymical Gods” [Dij Chymici], or indeed the “principle intellectual chymical gods” [praecipui dij intellectuales chymici]: Osiris, Isis, Mercurius, and Vulcanus, who are not celestial but rather subterranean, born of the art. Egyptian Isis is identified as Greek Ceres, and Osiris as Bacchus or Dionysus, “chief of the golden gods” [aureorum deorum primarius]. Osiris is explained to symbolize the “matter of the art, from which the golden Medicine is composed”; his death represents the alchemical process of “solution”; the tomb in which his dismembered body is placed by the “fiery and furious spirit” [spiritus igneus & furiosus] Typhon is the alchemical vessel. After this solution, Isis collects the parts and unites them with combustible sulfur, such that the soul of Osiris becomes sufficiently ardent that he converts Isis, mother—wife—sister, into himself, resulting in the ultimate hermaphroditic or androgynous perfection. The Arcana arcanissima contains a multitude of alchemical interpretations of mythological motifs; here, a scant few will have to suffice. On the grounds of Egyptian myth, the “black bull” Apis is “a hieroglyphic and indubitable character of the true and unique Philosophical Matter,” the “Chaos philosophicum,” containing all things. This is backed up with reference to Greek motifs, from the bulls of Minos, the story of Theseus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur in the Cretan labyrinth; Hercules’ fight with the three-bodied (or three-headed) giant Geryon, and Jason’s yoking of the fire-breathing bulls. The god Pan, as well as the Satyrs, including Silenus, companion of Dionysus, represent the “vileness, wildness, or rawness of philosophical matter.” The “story of the birth, struggle and victory of Dionysus graphically depicts the whole Philosophical artifice,” hence his appearance on the title page. Osiris’ deadly brother Typhon has an affinity with serpents and dragons, which is “proven” by Maier through the anagrammatical “transposition” of the letters of his name to “Python,” adversary of Apollo. Alchemically, Typhon represents “that foetid water that putrefies,” a “sulfurous and burning spirit,” while his wife Echidna denotes the “watery and cold flowing substance,” i.e., quicksilver. From their union arise the various mineral species, represented by their large brood of monstrous offspring, including Cerberus, the Sphinx, Chimaera, Hydra, and the hundred-headed dragon Ladon, guardian of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Much is said concerning Mercury, inventor of letters, numbers, musical instruments and intervals, observer of the courses of the stars, and psychopomp. While the lame god of the forge, Vulcan, is associated with fiery lions, Mercury is connected with dragons and serpents, such as the male and female snakes entwined around his caduceus. The wand represents his marvelous ability to reduce all dissident things to concord, whence the famous alchemical dictum, Est in Mercurio quicquid quaerunt sapientes [There is in Mercury whatever the wisemen seek]. In line with a multitude of other alchemists, Maier considers Mercurius to be the “subject of the chymical art,” indeed describing him with the extremely Christ-like epithet “Omnia in Omnibus” [All in All things]. In an entertaining piece of cod-etymology, we discover that the Egyptians called Mercury in their tongue Theut, with whom the Germans are connected, calling themselves “Theutonos sive Theutschen” [Teutonic or Deutsch]. Another major figure in Arcana arcanissima is the demi-god Hercules, son of Zeus and Alcmene, famous for his twelve Labors. While his father represents the internal agent of the art, its principle subject, Maier explains that Hercules is the external agent, the artifex himself. A whole book is devoted to the chymical interpretation of the Labors of Hercules, many of which easily connect with traditional alchemical symbolism: his first task was to slay the Nemean Lion, which was neither Asian nor African but celestial, and ultimately alchemical, with Maier adducing the Green Lion of the Rosarium philosophorum (Rose Garden of the Philosophers, 1550), Senior’s parable of the Hunting of the Lion, and the Consilium conjugii’s (Advice on the Conjuction) explanation that Leo is the Sol inferius [Lower Sun]. Hercules’ combat with the watery serpent, the Lernaean Hydra, is likewise identified as alchemical, with Basil Valentine’s De occulta philosophia (On Occult Philosophy) cited with reference to Mercury as a serpent from waters. In a similar fashion, Hercules’ task of obtaining the golden apples of the Hesperides, guarded by the 100-headed dragon, Ladon, is another labor amenable to alchemical interpretation. Maier in fact identifies three Greek heroes as representatives of the alchemical artifex: Hercules, Jason, and Odysseus. Jason’s quest with the Argonauts for the Golden Fleece, interpreted as “the Philosophical Stone, the highest medicine of human bodies,” is one of the best-known myths. Maier explains that Jason was assisted by the sorceress Medea, who made four potions [pharmaca]: 1) an unguent that protected his body from the dragon’s lethal fire and venom, as well as the fiery breath of the bulls; 2) a soporific narcotic to put the dragon to sleep, so that he could steal the fleece; 3) a limpid water that extinguished the bull’s fire; 4) a special image of the Sun and Moon, which he wore around his neck, for success in the work. In keeping with his insistence that true chymia concerns the Golden Medicine, Maier etymologically presents Jason’s name as a fitting example of nominative determinism: “for the name expresses healer, from Iasthai or healing; for Iasis is the art of healing.” Jason, like Hercules, was educated in healing by the centaur Chiron, from whom he gained manual experience, just as he gained the necessary advice and theory for the perfect completion of the work from Medea. Jason represents the “Medicus Philosophus,” while Medea represents “most outstanding assistance,” or reason. The Golden Medicine, like that prepared by Medea, included the powers of rejuvenation. Maier’s reading of myth was thus not only used for examples of interactions between alchemical substances, but also concerned the relationship between theory and practice. Again, Maier could cite alchemical authorities, such as Pseudo-Lull’s Testamentum (Testament), in support of his interpretation of the allegorical interpretations, for example “the Dragon, i.e. Fire, in which is our golden Stone, lives in all things.” Only someone blinder than a mole, Maier argues, would not see that these are all chymical fables. In the beginning of 1616 Maier returned to the continent, and the next few years were to see a flurry of publications. 1616 saw the appearance of De circulo physico quadrato, hoc est, auro eiusque virtute medicinali (On the Natural Circle Squared, i.e., Gold and its medicinal virtue), closely followed by Lusus serius, quo Hermes sive Mercurius rex mundanorum Omnium, &c. judicatus & constitutus (A Serious Jest [or: Game], by which Hermes or Mercurius is judged and appointed King of All Worldly Things, &c.), which appeared the same year. Neither of these works was as intent on mytho-chymia as the Arcana arcanissima, but both include mythological references. The following year, in 1617, there appeared the Examen fucorum pseudo-chymicorum (Swarm of Pseudo-Chymical Drones). There we find one or two mythological references—for example, one to Saturn throwing up a Stone that he had previously swallowed thinking it was his rival Jupiter, and another to the golden apples of the Hesperides—although the focus of the work is on fraudulent alchemical practice, for which he borrows heavily from Heinrich Khunrath’s pseudonymous Treuhertzige Warnungs-Vermahnung (Sincere Warning-Admonition), appended to Vom hylealischen Chaos (On Primaterial Chaos, 1597). Published around the same time, the Jocus severus (A Serious Joke, 1617), is an allegorical account of a tribunal of birds set up to judge the Night owl (Noctua), associated with the goddess of wisdom, and for Maier a symbol of Chemia. Again there are brief references to myth, one from the mouth of the Swallow (Philomela), doubtless emboldened by the criticisms of Natale Conti, claiming that chymia is full of fables and that those of the poets concern hidden chymical matters, rather than moral lessons. Then followed the Symbola aureae mensae (Symbols of the Golden Table, 1617), introducing a cosmopolitan lineage of alchemists from twelve different nations, ranging from the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus in antiquity to the modern “Anonymous Pole,” i.e., Michael Sendivogius (1566-1636). Contrary to his treatment of the ancient gods, who are explained as fictions, Maier emphasizes that Hermes Trismegistus is most definitely not a “fictitious person” [personam fictitiam] but a most ancient Egyptian Philosopher. In his discussion of Hermes, Maier returns to material discussed in Arcana arcanissima, including the myths of Apis, Osiris, Isis, and so forth as representatives of the Egyptian Chymical Gods; he references in particular the myth of the Golden Fleece, with Jason as the “physician with subtle stratagems” and Medea as “Counsel of Theoretical Reason.” While happy to discover chymical truth in pagan mythology, and indeed to go along with those, like Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500), who find a Christian message in analogical readings of Hermetic works, Maier criticizes those who “most impiously and sacrilegiously” attempt alchemical readings of the “Creation of the world, nativity, passion, death, resurrection and ascension of Christ.” Another of Maier’s publications from the same year may help explain this stance. In 1617 Maier publishes his first apologium for the Rosicrucians, Silentium post clamores (Silence after the Clamors), following the appearance of the three Rosicrucian manifestos, Fama fraternitatis (Rumor of the Brotherhood, 1614), Confessio fraternitatis R. C. (Confession of the Brotherhood, 1615) and Chymische Hochzeit (Chemical Wedding, 1616). The Fama explicitly condemns “books and figures [that] have been brought out under the name of chymia, which are in Contumeliam gloriae Dei [an insult to God’s glory].” Similar sentiments are expressed in the Confessio: “we must earnestly admonish you, that you cast away, if not all, yet most of the worthless books of pseudo-chymists, to whom it is a game to apply the Most Holy Trinity to vain things, or a joke to deceive men with monstrous figures and enigmas.” The same point is driven home in the Chymische Hochzeit, when the pseudo-chymists are separated from true practitioners: “you have forged false and spurious books, fooled and swindled others, thereby lowering the royal dignity in everyone’s eyes. You also know what blasphemous and seductive pictures you have used, sparing not even the Holy Trinity, but using it for the cozening of one and all.” While Maier was comfortable with making references to the Egyptian gods, or to Hercules and Jason, and their chymical significance, his admiration for the Rosicrucian message must have convinced him to avoid drawing analogies between the Stone and Christ. Perhaps, like the Catholics Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) and Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), he was concerned that such practices risked distorting scripture, “pass[ing] off the mysteries of our faith as natural things,” or making “alchemy the sole religion, the alchemist the sole religious person, and the tyrocinium of alchemy the sole catechism of the faith.” Atalanta fugiens (1618) Later that same year, there appears Maier’s best-known work, the Atalanta fugiens, which has been described as “the strangest, the most beautiful and the most innovative work of esoteric alchemy in the seventeenth century,” the “finest of all those curious works which typify Hermetic mythology,” with its idiosyncratic combination of the “textual” and “representational” traditions of mythology, fifty emblems with accompanying discourses, together with fifty musical fugues. The elaborate title page presents elements of the myth—found in Ovid’s Metamorphoses and Hyginus’ Fables—of the fleet-footed huntress Atalanta who could run faster than the East Wind and was only prepared to marry a man who could beat her in a foot race, slow suitors only being fit for target practice (fig. 2). Figure 2 Atalanta was eventually bested by Hippomenes, who outran her by dropping three golden apples, given to him by Venus, in order to distract her from the contest. At the foot of the page we see the Bridal Race with Hippomenes running for his life (and wife) and clutching two of the golden apples, while Atalanta stoops to pick up the first. The Author’s Preface at the start of the work succinctly explains the basic alchemical significance of the myth: Atalanta has the volatile nature of quicksilver while Hippomenes has the fiery nature of sulfur. In medieval chrysopoeia or gold-making alchemy, these were the two ingredients necessary for the creation of gold and the philosophers’ stone. At bottom right, we see the happy couple consummating their union in the Temple of Cybele—code for the alchemical athanor or furnace—for which profanation they were punished by being turned into the lions that pulled the goddess’ chariot. Michael Maier and Mytho-Chymia. At the top of the page we see the source of the golden apples, the Garden of the Hesperides, maintained by the three nymphs Aegle, Arethusa, and Hespertusa. The apples are guarded by the dragon Ladon, child of Typhon and Echidna, who occupies the same position as his father, Typhon, did on the Arcana arcanissima title page. On the left of the title we see Hercules, in the very same spot as on the Arcana arcanissima title page, wearing the skin of the Nemean Lion, picking some of the golden apples. On the right is the goddess Venus, giving Hippomenes the apples, together with a few tips on how to win the race. Readers of Ovid would know that it is Venus who tells the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes to her lover Adonis in book ten of the Metamorphoses; in fact, Maier includes in Emblem 41 of Atalanta fugiens the sad image of Adonis gored to death by a wild boar and Venus’ blood staining roses red as she rushes to him (fig. 3). Figure 3 Add to Collection Close reading of the text and viewing of the images will reveal that Maier’s title page anticipates themes in the book. There are three emblems, for example, concerned with Venus (23, 38, 41), four with apples (9, 22, 35, 44), two with lions (16, 37), and so forth. In the following 210 pages, Maier runs through a great deal of the material already introduced in the 285-page Arcana arcanissima, but this time with the addition of fifty high-quality engravings by Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593–1650), and the accompanying canons or fugues. Compare Emblems Venus Collection Add to Emblem Collections Apples Collection Add to Emblem Collections Lions Collection Add to Emblem Collections Maier opens the work with an image of Boreas the North Wind, familiar to readers from Metamorphoses 6.675–721, carrying a fetus in his belly, alluding to the line from the Tabula smaragdina “The Wind bore it in its belly” (fig. 4). In this way Maier cleverly creates an amalgam of classical mythological material and medieval and early modern alchemical matter. His openness to multiple levels of interpretation is evident from his commentary on this first image: Chymically, it is Sulphur, which is carried in Argent vive . . . physically, it is an infant [foetus] . . . Arithmetically, that it is the root of a Cube; Musically, that it is the Disdiapason; Geometrically, that it is a punctum the beginning of a running line; Astronomically, the center of the planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. Figure 4 Add to Collection Here Maier is probably challenging readers to flesh out his observations. Some at least would have known that Boreas is the father of two of the Argonauts, hence a connection with the mythoalchemical fable par excellence, Jason’s quest for the Golden Fleece. The distinctly unnatural womb for the fetus, Sulfur, would have caused some readers to think of the story of Dionysus whose mother, Semele, perished in a blaze of divine fire. His father, Zeus, rescued the unborn child and sewed him into his thigh, where he remained in incubation until ready to be born. Not all of Maier’s emblems are mytho-chymical; indeed, many contain little or no mythical material, but some stand out as particularly relevant. Emblem 12 is based on the tale of Saturn swallowing his offspring and includes a consideration of alchemical color changes related to the myth. Emblem 14, with the dragon devouring its tail, includes references to dragons, the Golden Fleece, the Garden of the Hesperides, plus equivalent discussion of dragon symbolism in alchemy from Pseudo-Lull and the most famous alchemical image sequence before the Atalanta fugiens, the Rosarium philosophorum. Emblem 19 uses the mythical figures Geryon, Medusa, Typhon, and Echidna as a springboard into a discussion of the interrelated nature of the four elements. Emblem 23, on the monstrous birth of Minerva from Jupiter’s head, refers to Hercules’ labor in the Augean stables, as well as Jason’s quest for the fleece as symbols of the opus. Emblem 25 again features a dragon, with reference to the Golden Fleece and Maier’s notion that Jason is the “true physician” [verus medicus] and Medea “Mind’s Counsel” [mentis consilio]. Emblem 35 introduces Triptolemus and Achilles, both of whom were strengthened by being dipped in or exposed to fire. In Emblem 41, on the death of Adonis, Maier explains that wild boar is the “sharpest acid” [acetum acerrimum] that kills or dissolves philosophical gold. Arguably Atalanta fugiens’ most mytho-chymical image is Emblem 44, concerning the dismemberment and reconstitution of Osiris. The accompanying discourse is replete with mythical Decknamen for substances, including a direct reference to Atalanta and Hippomenes. Maier’s interest in mythical themes continues, unabated, in subsequent works. Although the Tripus Aureus (Golden Tripod, 1618) is his edition of others' alchemical works, including his translation of the English alchemist Thomas Norton’s Ordinall of Alchemy, mythical references to Apollo and Diana, for instance, can be found in the pages of Basil Valentine’s Practica cum duodecim clavibus (Twelve Keys). The title page of Viatorium, hoc est, de montibus planetarum septem seu metallorum (A Travel-Guide, that is, On the Seven Mountains of the Planets or Metals, 1618) features planetary deities as symbolic representations of the alchemical metals, with the authorial epigram comparing alchemists to Theseus lost in Minos’ Labyrinth and in need of Ariadne’s thread, with the explanation that the Minotaur at the center represents the “materia philosophica.” Maier returns to familiar mythemes, including the Golden Fleece and the apples of the Hesperides, tricorporeal Geryon, Typhon as Python, and Hercules’ fight with the Nemean Lion. The same can be said for Maier’s second Rosicrucian apology, the Themis aurea (Golden Themis, 1618), where he refers to the “most industrious Artifex and most skilled Philosopher, Hercules,” to Osiris and Dionysus as “Chymical subjects,” and to Ulysses as the “wandering artifex.” In Verum inventum, hoc est, munera Germaniae (The True Discovery, or, The Gifts of Germany, 1619), Maier briefly returns to Natale Conti’s Mythologiae in a discussion of Typhon as a fire-breathing serpent [flammivomus serpens], Pluto, and “infernal Cerberus” [Cerberi infernalis]; elsewhere he mentions Pallas’ aegis bearing the head of Medusa; Pegasus, who sprang from the gorgon’s blood, and the Chimera, together with their nemeses, Perseus and Bellerophon, as well as Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the golden apples. Maier had already discussed the mythical phoenix in Arcana arcanissima and Lusus serius. He returns to the theme in Tractatus de volucri arborea (Treatise on the Arboreal Bird, 1619), together with references to Osiris and Typhon, the Labors of Hercules, the wanderings of Ulysses, Jason’s perils, Theseus’ deeds, golden apples, the flight of Atalanta, and Dionysus as philosophical fetus. In Septimana philosophica (A Philosophical Week, 1620), he asks whether the herb Moly, which Mercury gave Ulysses to protect himself against the potions of Circe, has any chymical properties, together with considerations of the Nemean Lion, the trees of the Hesperides, the chymical symbolism of the ibis, dragons, and serpents. Maier’s “poetic swan-song,” the Cantilenae intellectuales (Intellectual Songs, 1622), proposes an interpretation of the three apples that Hippomenes threw in front of Atalanta. The posthumously published Ulysses (1624) continues in the same vein, with references to the nymphs in the garden of the Hesperides, tales of the gods, and the fable of the Golden Fleece, all as “arcana Chymica”; and to Minerva’s birth from Jupiter’s head as the “science of sciences,” chymia. Michael Maier and Mytho-Chymia Michael Maier is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in the story of mythoalchemy, both for the extensive and systematic approach to alchemical exegesis of Egyptian and Greek mythology in Arcana arcanissima and for the somewhat more episodic and erratic approach in Atalanta fugiens, where nuggets suddenly appear in the text to entertain and beguile the reader, like the fabled apples dropped to distract Atalanta. Although others before him had drawn inspiration from ancient myth in the course of their reflections on alchemical symbolism, it was Maier, physician, chemist, composer, and poet laureate, who had the mixed skillset and courtly background to initiate a multimedia work like the Atalanta fugiens. Mythology was enjoying a vibrant cultural life in the early Baroque courts. Claudio Monteverdi and Alessandro Striggio’s opera, Orfeo, for instance, had its first performance before the court of Mantua in 1607. Drawing from experience of both the mythological aesthetic of Rudolf II’s impressive art collection in Prague—in particular the Mannerist works of Bartholomäus Spranger (1546–1611), Hans von Aachen (1552–1615), and Adriaen de Vries (1545–1626)—and then the alchemical masques at the court of James I in London, where he surely discovered many of the fugues that were to grace the Atalanta fugiens, Maier was ideally suited for a project designed to appeal on a multitude of levels to a cultured, educated courtly audience. Maier continued to display an interest in the relations between mythology and alchemy in almost all of his subsequent publications. Sometimes this interest manifests as an imaginative alchemical interpretation of pagan myth, sometimes as the importation of mythological discourse in order to make alchemical symbolism more accessible (and more palatable) to a humanist-trained readership. As a Rosicrucian apologist, Maier must have been aware of the low status of gold-making alchemy in the eyes of the authors of the manifestos and, as mentioned above, familiar with their condemnations of chymical works that transgress the boundaries of religion. Maier’s own criticism of authors who draw parallels between the passion of Christ and the preparation of the Stone doubtless reflects this sentiment, and perhaps his focus on pagan mythology serves as a deflection from alchemy being identified as blasphemy and an assertion of its cultural relevance. As Didier Kahn states, rooting alchemy in mythology is also a particularly useful strategy for extending knowledge of alchemy far back into the past, as something that predated classical authorities like Aristotle and Galen, thereby emphasizing its hoariness, its venerability. I would disagree with H. J. Sheppard’s claim that the time of Maier’s publications, when “alchemy produced its finest examples of pictorial symbolism,” necessarily coincided with “the negation of the material properties of alchemy” and “removed alchemy from the hands of the goldmaker.” As Hereward Tilton points out, gold-making may not have been the main goal of Maier’s practice, which was more concerned with the use of gold as aurum potabile [drinkable gold] in chemical medicine, but it was nevertheless part of his training and repertoire; indeed, many of the quotes in Atalanta fugiens have their sources in medieval chrysopoetic literature. Likewise, the rather simplistic tendency to relegate visual forms of alchemy to a form of “spiritual quest” should also be reconsidered. The multiple levels of exegesis (Chymical, Physical, Arithmetical, Musical, Geometrical, and Astronomical) suggested by Maier in his discussion of Emblem 1 avoid any suggestion that Atalanta fugiens or its mytho-chymical content should be construed as a “spiritual” work. What they do, instead, is insert chymical knowledge at the head of a list of predominantly liberal arts, an emphatic assertion of its intellectual worth. Given the variable and contesting interpretations of alchemical texts, terms, and images in general, it should not be expected that there was ever any agreement on alchemical interpretations of myth. Mythology was coopted to support alchemists’ individual theories, be they chrysopoetic, chymiatric, or phlogistic. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries certainly saw the publication of numerous works whose titles contain references to mythical figures; some, like Pierre-Jean Fabre’s Hercules Piochymicus (Devoutly Chymical Hercules, 1634), claimed to reveal alchemical and Christian secrets in Hercules’ Labors, while Ehrd von Naxagoras’ (i.e., Johann Erhard Neithold) Aureum vellus (Golden Fleece, 1733) discusses various renditions of the tale of the Golden Fleece. Many, however, display no interest in mythoalchemical reflection or speculation, as, for instance, David de Planis Campy’s L’Hydre morbifique exterminée par l’Hercule chimique (The Morbific Hydra Exterminated by the Chymical Hercules, 1628); Johann Baptista Grosschedel’s Proteus Mercurialis geminus (Twofold Mercurial Proteus, 1629); Christoph Reibehand’s Filum Ariadnes (Ariadne’s Thread, 1639); Johannes Baptista Marengus’ Palladis chymicae arcana detecta (The Secrets of Chymical Pallas Revealed, 1678), or Johann Joachim Becher’s Oedipus chymicus (Chymical Oedipus, 1680). The best-known author undeniably indebted to Maier must be Dom Antoine-Joseph Pernety (1716–1796), who plagiarized Arcana arcanissima in his Fables égyptiennes et grecques dévoilées (Egyptian and Greek Fables Unveiled, 1758). Although Maier complains about the expenses he incurred in his publications, Atalanta fugiens apparently enjoyed some success, for it was reprinted in 1618, and reappeared in modified form, without the fugues, later in the century as the Scrutinium chymicum (Chymical Investigation) in 1687. His highly creative combination of alchemy, music, and myth continues to inspire artists, musicians, psychotherapists, and at least some historians to this day.

Composed of elegantly-rendered figural groups typically set within mountainous landscapes that sometimes make direct reference to the German lands in which the book was produced, the etchings offer visual interpretations of the cryptic mottos that accompany each of the volume’s fifty emblems. The quality of these pictures, perhaps more than any other aspect of this notable publication, has secured its place of distinction in the alchemical literature of early modern Europe. While the figural compositions undoubtedly were influenced by Maier, who took inspiration from numerous textual and pictorial sources, the actual plates are the work of the de Bry book publishing firm in Oppenheim. It is appropriate to begin, therefore, with a consideration of this family’s pictorial contribution to Atalanta fugiens. In 1588, Theodor de Bry and his sons, Johann Theodor and Johann Israel, having fled the southern Netherlands as Calvinist exiles, arrived in the free imperial city of Frankfurt am Main, where they quickly established a reputation as engravers and publishers of high-quality illustrated books. The de Bry family was best known for its two series of illustrated travel accounts, the India occidentalis (West Indies, 1590–1634) and the India orientalis (East Indies, 1597–1628). In his engraved self-portrait of 1615, Johann Theodor, who oversaw these long-term projects after the deaths of his father and brother, stands proudly before two stacks of pages labeled with the titles of these collections (fig. 1). But the engraved plate that he props up with his left hand on top of the stacks, with its vanitas image and the motto “Quis Evadet” [Who will be spared?], highlights the emblematic publications that were also an important part of his firm’s repertoire. Figure 1 The alchemical emblems of Atalanta fugiens belong to a period of extraordinary productivity between 1609 and 1620 during which Johann Theodor relocated the firm to the Palatinate town of Oppenheim and published the profusely illustrated alchemical works of Maier and the English Hermetic philosopher Robert Fludd. Unlike Frankfurt, which showed wavering support for its community of Reformed exiles, the Calvinist state of the Palatinate under the Elector Palatine, Frederick V, provided a liberal religious and intellectual climate that promoted the publishing of works of alchemical and occult interest and, as Frances Yates has shown, allowed for the flourishing of a “Rosicrucian Enlightenment.” Johann Theodor de Bry, a shrewd businessman, took advantage of these conditions until 1620, when the onset of the Thirty Years War forced him to return to Frankfurt. During its busy years in Oppenheim, the de Bry firm was fortunate to add a talented and productive member to the family, Matthäus Merian, who in February 1617 married Johan Theodor’s daughter, Maria Magdalena de Bry. Merian was a native of Basel who learned the technique of etching during his apprenticeship in Zurich and refined his skills in Strasbourg, Nancy, and Paris before arriving in Oppenheim. Etching requires the artist to draw a design with a pointed stylus, or “needle,” directly on a copper plate that has been covered with an acid-resistant ground. When the plate is then submerged in acid, the exposed lines are etched into the plate so they can hold ink for printing. Etching is the closest of the printmaking processes to pen-and-ink drawing and is carried out much more quickly than engraving, a laborious process in which the artist uses the palm of his hand to push the point of a burin—the tool held in Johann Theodor’s left hand in his self-portrait—into the copper plate. As an etcher, Merian was better-suited to meeting heavy demands for illustrations than was his father-in-law, to whom no known etchings have been attributed. Although no artist is named on the title page of Atalanta fugiens or on that of Fludd’s magnum opus, the Utriusque cosmi [. . .] historia (The History of the Macrocosm and Microcosm, 1617–1621), we can safely attribute the etched plates in both publications to Merian. Merian not only brought expertise in etching to the de Bry firm; he brought expertise in landscape representation as well, and indeed his reputation as a printmaker rests largely on his views of European cities and their surroundings. Etching and landscape had been closely linked since both appeared on the scene during the first half of the sixteenth century. Some of the earliest German artists to develop the genre of independent landscape, including Albrecht Altdorfer and Augustin Hirschvogel, recognized the possibilities of the new printmaking process for translating their distinctive landscape drawing styles into a reproductive medium. And landscape remained an important subject for northern European etchers of the seventeenth century like Merian and his Dutch contemporary Claes Jansz. Visscher. In the contents page to Visscher’s series of topographical landscapes, Pleasant Places (1611), an architectural frame surrounds an appealing view of a lighthouse in the dunes outside Haarlem. Before our eyes can take in this landscape, however, they are confronted with the etcher’s needles, bottles of mordant, and copper plate, all of which rest on the sill of the frame (fig. 2). Etching, Visscher’s print suggests, makes it possible to preserve the vividness of the artist’s own direct experience of nature in a reproduction. An accomplished topographical etcher, Merian lavished an unusual attention on landscape in the emblems for Atalanta fugiens. Approaching these pictures through their landscapes can offer fresh insight into this artist’s unique contribution to alchemical imagery. Figure 2 List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography Foreground Before proceeding into the background, however, it seems appropriate to make our entry into Merian’s pictures through the emblem in the foreground. Emblematics was another genre in which Merian was prolific. His earliest emblems date to 1614 when, in Paris, he created twelve plates for the Emblemata amatoria (Emblems of Love), and he continued to be active in this field throughout his career. Among his best-known endeavors are the fifty etchings for Atalanta fugiens, and one hundred moral and political emblems for Julius Wilhelm Zincgref’s Emblematum ethico-politicorum centuria (One Hundred Ethical-Political Emblems, 1619), the most celebrated German emblem book of the seventeenth century and also the first publication from the de Bry firm to include Merian’s name on its title page. The emblem has its origins in the ancient literary genre of the epigram, but its typical early modern format was established with the publication of Andrea Alciato’s Emblematum liber (Book of Emblems) in 1531. Alciato’s book made the interpretation of the epigram into a witty and learned game by appending to it a brief motto and a picture, inviting the reader to engage in the pleasurable task of decoding hidden meanings by considering all three parts together. Maier, who adds a musical component and a prose commentary to Alciato’s tripartite scheme, tells us on the title page of Atalanta fugiens that his emblems are “not without Singular delectation, to be seen, read, meditated, Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard.” The emblem is, from a modern viewpoint, inherently interdisciplinary, and for this reason it would be inappropriate to isolate any one part of it for specialized analysis. Its meanings can be found only in the relationship between its parts. In the baroque world of emblematics, all things are linked through chains of resemblance that bind together the mundane and spiritual realms. While emblems often have a strong “natural history” component, for example, an animal present in an emblem is never to be understood as a member of a particular species, but through the moral, humoral, and philological associations it has acquired over time. The salamander, which is pictured in Emblem 29 of Atalanta fugiens, was reported to survive in fire by various ancient authorities including Aristotle, Pliny, and Avicenna, the last of whom is the source of Maier’s motto, “As the Salamander lives in fire so also the Stone” (fig. 3). In Merian’s picture, a salamander with a row of stars across its back (a feature described by Pliny) crouches cat-like amidst the flames while turning its head into the billowing smoke, seemingly unharmed by the fire. As with a biblical parable, however, a literal reading of the picture is insufficient: one must see through the outward form in order to discover a macrocosmic significance. Maier helps us to do so not only with references to the lapis [stone] in his motto and epigram, but by explaining in his commentary that the “philosophical salamander” (i.e., the philosophers’ stone) resembles the common salamander in its imperviousness to fire. Figure 3 Add to Collection Maier’s courtly, humanistic brand of alchemy lent itself to emblematic thinking. Just as he sought to transform the soul through the skilled and learned manipulation of sensible matter, so his emblems promise to reveal the deepest secrets of nature through their appeal to the senses. In his preface, Maier declares that if his book seems more intellectual, than sensual, the more profitable and delightful will it be in time: but if it be first in bondage to the sense, there is no doubt but there will be a passage from the sense to the understanding as by a door: for nothing is said to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense, the understanding of a man new born being supposed as a smooth table, wherein nothing is as yet written, but any thing may be written by the help of sense, as a Styl[us]. For Maier, the senses are clearly indispensable to the pursuit of alchemical understanding, yet like Aristotle to whom he alludes in the above passage, he also insists on a hierarchy of knowledge. The “common salamander” pictured in Merian’s etching may resemble the “philosophical salamander” of the intellect, but the difference between the two is equally important: while the common salamander is said to withstand the fire because of its cold and wet nature, in the ideal salamander all the elements are perfectly balanced. The emblem engages our senses, but it does so in order to disconnect us from a merely corporeal experience of a fallen and corrupt world, setting us down a symbolic pathway toward the retrieval of universal concepts hidden in nature. Maier’s Aristotelian stylus for writing these concepts on the blank tablet of the reader’s intellect was Merian’s etching needle, and the collaboration between the two men resulted in an extraordinarily rich and inventive alchemical iconography. Some of this imagery had its origin in previous works. Such is the case of Emblem 30, “Luna is as requisite to Sol as a hen to a cock” (fig. 4). Figure 4 Add to Collection Figure 5 Merian’s picture features a nude man with the face of the sun, a nude woman with the face of the moon, and a cock and hen at their feet. The content is simple, but also full of symbolic resonance within the alchemical tradition. The sun represents hot and dry sulfur, the moon cold and moist mercury; and just “as the cock is desired by the hen,” the epigram informs us, so the moon needs the sun for their philosophical union. The source for the motto and image is an alchemical text that Maier knew well, the Rosarium philosophorum (Rose Garden of the Philosophers), a work culled from various medieval sources and published in a Frankfurt edition in 1550 with woodcuts. In one of its images, a nude king and queen stand upon the sun and moon, offering one another flowers, declaring their marriage, and united by a dove signifying the life-giving spirit (fig. 5). Merian transforms his model by fusing the human figures with their chemical symbols, thus personifying the gendered elements of sulfur and mercury, and by adding a new layer of meaning with the cock and hen. The result is an image that is concise in its expression and multi-layered in its symbolism. It is one of several plates in Atalanta fugiens that are derived, to different degrees, from the woodcuts of the Rosarium philosophorum. Figure 6 Add to Collection By no means, however, do all of the pictures in Atalanta fugiens originate in alchemical sources, as we see in the case of the Old Testament figure of Naaman, the subject of Emblem 13 (fig. 6). Naaman, commander of the Syrian army and a leper, is told by the prophet Elisha to wash himself seven times in the river Jordan, which cures him of his disease. The subject was occasionally depicted in biblical illustrations, and Merian himself later treated it in one of the plates for his influential Icones biblicae (Biblical Icons, 1625–1627) (fig. 7). In this later version, Merian was primarily concerned with translating a textual narrative into a visual format. We are led into the scene by the servants and soldiers on shore, who watch over Naaman’s armor as he bathes and with whom we bear witness to the miracle of his cure. In the background we see earlier stages in the story as Naaman walks with his servant toward the river. In Atalanta fugiens, in contrast, narrative is subordinated to the emblematic significance of Naaman himself, who sits alone on the shore of the river, nude and without even his identifying armor beside him. Naaman’s meaning unfolds not through narrative but through his relation to the motto and epigram, both of which compare his story to the purification of the philosophers’ stone. While this comparison had been made previously in alchemical literature, Merian for the first time formulates it in a visual image. Figure 7 Emblem 13 also exemplifies the wide resonance of Maier’s and Merian’s emblematic imagery within the context of the Palatinate in the early seventeenth century. The Rosicrucianism that informed the writings of Maier and Fludd yoked alchemical and hermetic thought to the pursuit of a world Reformation centered on the Elector Frederick V. Surely the significance of Naaman, as a figure of purification, extends beyond chemical transformation alone to hopes for a more general political and religious transformation. Merian and the de Brys shared these hopes. Although there is no evidence that they held specifically Rosicrucian sympathies, their very presence in Oppenheim was a result of the Elector’s openness to their Reformist beliefs as they sought freedom to practice their Calvinist faith. We might even read into the Naaman emblem an impulse toward the purification of the visual image that was fundamental to Reformed aesthetics. The emblem form appealed to Protestants because of its capacity to lead beyond the sensory appeal of the image to invisible, spiritual truths. Of course the emblem could become corrupted, but all the more reason to bring to it a Reformer’s vigilance. In the dedicatory letters of their Emblemata saecularia (Secular Emblems, 1596, 1611), a book of emblems interleaved with blank escutcheons for personal autographs, Johann Theodor and Johann Israel de Bry express their desire to cleanse a tradition that had been defiled by lewd pictures aimed at perverting simple minds. A similar impulse informs the emblems of Atalanta fugiens. The motto of Emblem 13 refers to the “Aes philosophorum,” literally the “philosophers’ copper,” which is sick and, like Naaman, must be washed. The relevance of the phrase to the material worked by the etcher could not have been lost on Merian, who by bathing his plates in acid sought to transform earthly copper into spiritual gold. While we have no textual record of Merian’s thoughts about his etchings for Atalanta fugiens, we do know that Maier was thinking about them in alchemical terms. Punning on the word “Venus,” the alchemical symbol for copper, he writes in his preface that the pictures in his book are “incised in Venus or copper, not without charm [Venere] or grace.” Maier’s comment makes it clear, moreover, that in the alchemical pursuit of purification and universal concepts, the sensory appeal of Merian’s etchings, their “charm” and “grace,” cannot be ignored. In the picture for Emblem 21, for instance, a philosopher holds the points of an enormous pair of dividers to a wall and traces a large circle around representations of a man and woman who have already been inscribed within smaller geometric shapes (fig. 8). The emblem’s motto, taken from the Rosarium philosophorum, instructs the adept: A circle for the man and wife provide, Which make quadrangular with equal side, That trigonal, resulting in a Sphere: And then the blessed Stone to you will appear. Figure 8 Add to Collection It is a complex emblem in which the geometrical quest to square the circle is fused with the alchemical quest to transcend contraries: male and female, sulfur and mercury, spirit and matter. But for all of its preoccupation with the abstract domain of mathematical ideas, Merian’s picture insists upon representation as an embodied act, one that in this case is performed by a philosopher-artist on a “canvas” of crumbling plaster and brick whose ostentatious materiality competes with the theoretical interest of the emblem’s geometrical forms. In the quick and irregular hatches, dots, and scribbles of the etcher’s needle, we encounter a powerful evocation of earthly decay that puts one in mind of the “speaking ruins” that Giovanni Battista Piranesi will later depict in his masterful etchings of ancient Rome. The wall’s crumbling surface serves as a memento mori in the face of the philosopher’s outsized confidence in geometry. And yet the wall goes unremarked upon in Maier’s motto, epigram, or commentary. Instead it serves quietly as a kind of landscape, a sensory background against which the emblem in the foreground will be invested with meaning. Background What of those expansive landscapes that stretch out behind the figures of Sol and Luna, and behind Naaman as he bathes in the Jordan? Nearly all of the pictures in Atalanta fugiens—with the exception of a few interior scenes, an image of the solar system, and the salamander crouching amidst flames and smoke—include at least some landscape elements, and many, such as Emblem 36, are truly impressive in their breadth and detail (fig. 9). According to this emblem’s motto, the philosophers’ stone has been “cast upon the earth, and exalted on mountains, and resides in the air, and is nourished in water.” Merian represents the stone as cubes, and to accommodate their elemental course through earth, air, and water, he sets them within a flourishing river valley. A road leads several travelers, along with the viewer, toward settlements that Merian’s biographer, Lucas Heinrich Wüthrich, identifies as the towns of Bad Cannstatt and Berg (both now incorporated into modern-day Stuttgart), located on opposite sides of the river Neckar and depicted by Merian in drawings he had made in 1616. Beyond these towns, our eyes are pulled into a distant, mountainous landscape where Merian, with the economy of a virtuoso etcher, conjures the textures of rock, architecture, vegetation, and sky. Figure 9 Add to Collection Merian was certainly not the first artist to attend to landscape in emblems, but the extraordinary care he gives to the settings of his pictures for Atalanta fugiens and for his next emblematic publication, Zincgref’s Emblematum ethico-politicorum centuria, takes this attention to an unprecedented level within the genre. In the latter volume, Merian’s depiction of specific locales in the Palatinate and surrounding regions anticipates his multivolume topographical publications of the 1630s and 1640s—the Theatrum Europeaum (Theater of Europe) and the Topographia Germaniae (Topography of Germany)—that became the basis of his fame as an etcher and publisher. Figure 10 In Emblem 67 of the Zincgref volume, for example, the Palatine lion holds a book with the motto of Heidelberg University as it stands before Heidelberg castle, the city, and the bridge over the Neckar (fig. 10). That we can identify this locale, the seat of the Elector Palatine, is significant given the political context of the volume and its dedication to Frederick V. The picture’s circular form, moreover, highlights its close association with the portrait medal, which typically included an emblematic image on its reverse and was a common form of commemorating sovereigns in early modern Europe. The medallion format is thus an entirely appropriate choice for emblems dedicated to the Elector, although it also has the effect of underscoring the allegorical function of these landscapes. The rectangular format of Merian’s etchings for Atalanta fugiens, on the other hand, is less insistent on this point. These images belong to the naturalistic aesthetic of the panel picture as codified by Leon Battista Alberti, whose grid-based perspectival system accommodated human visual experience to the rectilinear picture, offering direct access to nature through its four-sided “window.” And yet, despite Merian’s invitation to enter into the backgrounds of his alchemical emblems, these landscapes are not addressed in Maier’s commentaries and are rarely discussed in the scholarship on Atalanta fugiens. Why is this the case? Alberti is helpful on this question as well, for even though he praised the restorative effect of a pleasing landscape on the viewer, as a humanist he located the true content of the artwork in its istoria, a term that refers to harmonious and persuasive figural compositions that move the beholder in the same way that a well-told history moves a reader. “I look at a good painting,” writes Alberti, “with as much pleasure as I take in the reading of a good istoria. Both are the work of painters: one paints with words, the other tells the story with his brush.” Like a good painting, the emblem is loquacious; it speaks through mottos, epigrams, and in Atalanta fugiens its voice is enhanced with fugues and extensive commentaries. Landscape, in contrast, has difficulty making itself heard. The Latin term that Renaissance art theorists used for landscape was parergon, a word borrowed from Pliny and meaning “by-work” or, as a seventeenth-century English lexicographer put it, “all that which in a Picture is not of the body or argument thereof.” Figure 11 Add to Collection Consider Merian’s etching for Emblem 32, “As Coral grows under water, and is hardened by the air, So also is the Stone” (fig. 11). A figure in the foreground reaches into a river with a long hook to pull up a piece of coral, but the picture’s primary visual draw is the picturesque landscape and its rich variety of vegetation, mountains, hills, and classical architecture that evokes Sicily where, as the epigram informs us, this moist “plant” lives. This etching is one of the most fully realized landscapes in Atalanta fugiens, but if we are to understand it according to Alberti’s humanist model of picturing, the background must be considered secondary to the alchemical content addressed by Maier in the emblem’s textual apparatus. Figure 12 Merian nevertheless dedicated much of his career to such supplemental work. Only a few years after the publication of Atalanta fugiens, for example, Peter Aubry published a view of Heidelberg by Merian that is very close in composition to Emblem 36 (fig. 12). In this landscape, there is no philosophers’ stone to provide its “argument,” although things do happen: we witness the daily to and fro in the city’s outskirts as two travelers (very similar to those in Emblem 36) encounter a wagon along the road while boat traffic makes its way down the Neckar. These small details belong to the work of “chorography,” a term that early moderns took from Claudius Ptolemy, who contrasted it with the work of geography. While the geographer, according to Ptolemy, is concerned with the “the extent of the entire earth, as well as its shape, and its position under the heavens,” the chorographer focuses on surveying the local, “even dealing with the smallest conceivable localities, such as harbors, farms, villages, river courses, and such like.” It is a practice we might associate with the man who kneels in the left foreground of Merian’s landscape as he lays a boundary stone, and who like Merian himself is concerned with defining the limits of the local Palatine terrain. While this quiet chorographical work seems modest in ambition, it is difficult to overstate its importance for northern European art of the seventeenth century. To find a language capable of articulating this importance, we must look beyond the Albertian model of painting as istoria. Merian’s contemporary René Descartes, in his short treatise on optics, La dioptrique (Optics, 1637), points us in the right direction: You can see that etchings and engravings, being made of nothing but a little ink placed here and there on the paper, represent to us forests, towns, men, and even battles and storms, even though, among an infinity of diverse qualities which they make us conceive in these objects, only in shape is there actually any resemblance. And even this resemblance is a very imperfect one, seeing that, on a completely flat surface, they represent to us bodies which are of different heights and distances, and even that following the rules of perspective, circles are often better represented by ovals rather than by other circles; and squares by diamonds rather than by other squares; and so for all other shapes. So that often, in order to be more perfect as images and to represent an object better, they must not resemble it. Writing in Holland, where he had ample opportunity to encounter the topographical work of Dutch landscape etchers such as Visscher, Descartes recognized that the “content” of these landscapes was the nature of human vision itself. They show us how we see; that what we know to be circles, for example, are seen by the eye as ovals. The skilled printmaker is able to reproduce these effects on a flat surface and create a convincing image of the world precisely by “not resembling it” too closely. And of course we take aesthetic pleasure in the results, as Descartes clearly does. We are taken in by the way Merian depicts the walls, archways, roofs, and domes of a distant city in Emblem 32 with a few tiny, well-placed lines, or by the way he creates the appearance of distant trees rustling in the wind through the subtlest variations in his stippling. The concern with optical perception in the backgrounds of Merian’s alchemical etchings would seem to be at odds with their emblematic foregrounds, which, after all, invite us to see beyond mere outward appearances. And indeed, this tension between a descriptive art focused on the visible surfaces of the world, and an emblematic art that seeks to reveal the meanings concealed beneath those surfaces, has figured prominently in art-historical debates over the proper interpretive approach to seventeenth-century northern realism. We should be careful, however, not to ascribe these two modes of picture-making to distinct “world views.” Certainly, Merian and Maier would not have seen them as incompatible. In his Preface, Maier declares that it is the highest pursuit of the “generously educated” alchemist to disclose the “infinite” arcana that God has concealed in nature. But, he goes on, “next after such intellectual sciences as these are reckoned those which treat of a visible and audible object, as are Optics, or perspectives, and Picture.” This same hierarchical but complementary relationship between esoteric knowledge and the practical science of vision is rehearsed in Fludd’s Utriusque cosmi [. . .] historia, which Merian was illustrating at the same time he was working on Atalanta fugiens. Fludd’s first volume, De macrocosmi structurae (On the Structure of the Macrocosm, 1617), addresses the metaphysical question of cosmic origins, while the second volume, De naturae simia (On the Ape of Nature, 1618), turns its attention to those practical arts and sciences—including geometry, optics, and the pictorial arts—through which man becomes the “ape of nature.” Figure 13 Merian’s opening image for Fludd’s section on geometry and the art of measurement is, once again, a landscape into which we are led by a large outcropping of rock on the left and a prominent central waterway that leads the eye toward a distant townscape (fig. 13). In this instance, however, the work of surveying takes center stage as two figures demonstrate the use of a surveying staff that, along with the astronomical quadrant, Fludd discusses at length as essential tools for determining the size and distance of objects in the landscape. In the next section Fludd moves on to the science of optics where, with the help of Merian’s extensive illustrations, he not only explains the physiology of the eye and how it sees, but also teaches the art of perspective drawing. This knowledge in turn proves essential for a section on the art of picturing, and it is appropriate that this next section concludes, as the practical geometry section began, with a landscape (fig. 14). An artist-surveyor stands at the center of the composition with his back to us, his vision aligned with orthogonals that determine the relative size and position of objects in the picture. The art of picturing, Merian’s etching suggests, precisely is the delimitation of the landscape. As Ptolemy writes, “chorography needs an artist, and no one presents it rightly unless he is an artist.” Figure 14 It is worth noting that the tools of the surveyor appear in one of the plates for Atalanta fugiens we have already considered. In Emblem 21, a quadrant and what looks like a simple surveying instrument called a “Jacob’s staff,” both of which Merian illustrated for Fludd, lie at the feet of the alchemist (fig. 15). Although he has dropped them in favor of the compasses, a symbol of theoretical rather than practical labor, these abandoned instruments suggest that the pursuit of metaphysical truths begins in the field. It is here, at the feet of this artist-philosopher, that we should locate Merian’s contribution to Atalanta fugiens. Figure 15 In the backgrounds of Merian’s emblems, the landscape quietly establishes the rules according to which nature is perceived, measured, and represented. While the alchemist may seek to reveal meanings concealed behind these appearances, Merian’s landscapes provide the practical conditions for emblematic interpretation, which must begin with the senses. It is a lesson contained in the master trope of Maier’s book, the foot race between Atalanta and Hippomenes, which Merian depicts in the lower left corner of the title page (fig. 16). Seeking to win the race and Atalanta’s love, Hippomenes casts the golden apples that Venus has given him into Atalanta’s path. Unable to resist the fruit, Atalanta slows down to retrieve it, allowing Hippomenes to overtake her. Much has been written, by Maier and by subsequent scholars, about how this myth provides a metaphor for the pursuit of the philosophers’ stone through the union of sulfur (Hippomenes) and mercury (Atalanta). But it is also a story about the fifty copper plates that are cast before the reader of Atalanta fugiens. Only by slowing down to reflect on their surfaces, on the “charm” and “grace” of landscapes in which the etcher’s needle brilliantly takes the measure of the world and of human perception, can we grasp their significance in the alchemical pursuit of nature’s secrets.

With its multiple typefaces, music, and etchings, it is a virtuoso specimen of early modern print technology and a prime example of the beautiful engraved books produced by the renowned publisher Johann Theodor de Bry and illustrated by Matthäus Merian. List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography The book unfolds as a series of fifty emblems, each containing multiple parts: a motto and epigram in German and Latin, a copperplate etching, a fugue for three voices, and a Latin discourse that expands on the emblem’s themes. Atalanta fugiens presents an alchemical realm where deities, heroes, and mortals mingle within fantastic landscapes and elaborate interiors. Some of the emblems depict identifiable laboratory processes, encoding alchemical practice and the marvels of material transformations in allegorical images. The layout of the book itself is elegant in its symmetry. The musical scores on the left mirror the images on the right; together with the surrounding text and subsequent discourses, each emblem set makes a neat package of music, image, and text. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The content of Atalanta fugiens is no less masterful, invoking a kind of erudition that was prevalent enough among scholars in 1618 but is rare today. Maier’s title page gestures to an Ovidian legend—the tale of the fleet-footed huntress Atalanta, whom Hippomenes hopes to best in a race by dropping three distracting golden apples in her path. In Maier’s hands, however, Ovid’s central characters become chymical materials, while their interactions and transformations turn the ancient myth into a multimedia alchemical allegory designed to engage the ear, eye, and intellect. Only a reader equipped with a deep knowledge of classical myth, alchemy, natural history, music, mathematics, steganography, and medicine (not to mention the ability to read musical notation, German, and Latin) would have been up to the challenge of grasping the full significance of Maier’s clever text in 1618. As intimidating and kaleidoscopic as Atalanta fugiens may seem, however, its proposition is simple: all of the book’s parts are meant to work together, combining synergistically to reveal—or even produce—new insights into nature’s secrets. A shrewd reader could hope to acquire alchemical techniques for making powerful medicines or precious metals, and even knowledge about the origins and transformation of matter. In 1618, Maier offered his readers a puzzle, a game, a chance to test out their own virtuosity and to uncover nature’s secrets. In other words, Michael Maier invited his readers to engage with the text in ways that might today be considered playful—and they have been playing with Atalanta fugiens ever since. While we recognize and celebrate the fact that Atalanta fugiens has had an unusually long and rich afterlife as an intellectual, musical, and aesthetic object, the following essays approach Maier’s text first and foremost as a historical artifact whose playfulness must be understood in the intellectual, cultural, political, and religious context of early seventeenth-century Europe. Our exploration of Atalanta fugiens emerges out of an intentional multidisciplinary collaboration among scholars of early modern print, music, art, philosophy, mathematics, and alchemy. We explore how Atalanta fugiens both contributed to and was shaped by early modern debates about epistemology and the senses, cryptography, humor and ludic culture, print as an instrument for producing knowledge, as well as the status of alchemy in a period in which it was deeply contested. Our starting point is the assertion that if in 1618 Maier could reasonably expect a single reader to have the wide-ranging erudition and skill-set to engage his book, then unpacking the riches of Atalanta fugiens today requires multidisciplinary collaboration. For example, some modern scholars may read Latin but not German (or vice versa), while others may understand the visual conventions Maier draws on in his emblem landscapes but be entirely unfamiliar with the Phrygian mode in early modern music. Anthropomorphized images of philosophical sulfur or mercury are old hat to historians of alchemy, while to others, they might look like bizarre flights of fancy. In short, the fracturing of expertise into disciplinary bodies of knowledge means that scholars today can only grapple fully with the many dimensions of Maier’s ambitious text through multidisciplinary collaboration. We view Atalanta fugiens, therefore, as an invitation and a challenge to reassemble collectively the expertise that Maier’s book demands. This approach departs from previous scholarship on Atalanta fugiens in several ways. First, this collection of essays is framed as a multidisciplinary conversation. Existing scholarly studies of Atalanta fugiens have tended to highlight a single element of the book. For example, the major English-language study, H. M. E. de Jong’s 1969 Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens”: Sources of an Alchemical Book of Emblems, focuses primarily on the intertextuality of the book. De Jong’s crucial insight was to identify the corpus of alchemical, medical, mythological, and natural historical works from which Maier drew both explicitly and implicitly, and her study makes clear the extent to which Atalanta fugiens is a masterful work of textual synthesis. Maier’s authorship, she shows, lies primarily in his ability to weave together well-known alchemical aphorisms and to juxtapose them with new frameworks (not least the Ovidian tale of Atalanta and Hippomenes). De Jong’s attention to the literary elements of Atalanta fugiens, however, leaves open their relationship to the book’s images and music. Meanwhile, other scholars have maintained a tight focus on the music, select images, or Maier’s philosophical commitments. All of these studies have advanced our understanding of Atalanta fugiens in important ways, and certainly deep disciplinary expertise is crucial for situating Maier’s project in specific philosophical, artistic, literary, or musical contexts; however, approaching Atalanta fugiens from the perspective of one or two disciplinary perspectives at a time also has its limits. Maier’s intention, after all, was to integrate sight, sound, and intellect, and so we, too, must grapple with the connections, synergies, and also tensions he laid out. Earlier studies of Atalanta fugiens have also relied on an understanding of early modern alchemy that has been significantly challenged in recent decades. Once seen either negatively, as “superstition” or “pseudoscience,” or, more positively, as a primarily literary or philosophical project closely linked with Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and other “occult” philosophies, early modern alchemy is now also recognized as a fundamentally material endeavor, a set of practices deeply engaged with understanding and enacting the transformation of matter and closely associated with early modern science and medicine. Informed by this new scholarly consensus in the history of alchemy, the following essays view Atalanta fugiens not only as a literary or philosophical text, cleverly adorned with music as well, but also as an invocation of actual laboratory technologies, potentially even a guide to the production of the philosophers’ stone. The fact that Maier’s laboratory secrets are embedded in a such a virtuoso multimedia text, however, begs the question of its format—and makes clear the need for a multidisciplinary approach—even more urgently. If Maier wanted to communicate something about chymical processes, then why not simply publish a more straightforward book of recipes? There are many possible answers to this question, of course. Perhaps he wanted to hide his most profound secrets from the untutored, unworthy, or lazy, even as he divulged them for all to see in print. Maier also sought to elevate alchemy above its grubby artisanal roots, establishing it as a humanist, philosophical, emblematic, courtly art with the potential to access nature’s arcana. On this count Atalanta fugiens certainly succeeds, demonstrating that alchemy offered not just precious medicines or metals, but also fodder for mathematical games, musical riddles, artistic virtuosity, and classical erudition. Maier’s insistence on representing his chymical secrets musically, visually, and textually suggests that the multimedia format of Atalanta fugiens is a clue to Maier’s broader arguments. The first two essays in this collection, from Tara Nummedal and Michael Gaudio, argue for new ways of understanding how Maier’s audience may have read or looked at Atalanta fugiens. Nummedal explores the experience and interpretation of Atalanta fugiens through an examination of multiple modes of reading. She reveals the structural framework that underpins Atalanta fugiens, showing how the design of this book adheres to both a horizontal and a vertical orientation. In one modality, the reader moves across Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book with the turn of each page; in the other, the individual emblem requires that the eye travel down the page, an action that invites lingering and contemplation of its textual and visual interplay in penetrating its hidden meaning. Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book is thus designed as both codex and scroll. At the same time, Nummedal argues that these reading practices also engage the reader’s body, making the act of reading Atalanta fugiens into an exploration of the relationship between intellect and senses and, ultimately, of the proper practice of chymistry. In turn, the essay by Michael Gaudio focuses on the captivating copper-plate etchings by the artist Matthäus Merian that have assured Atalanta fugiens’ renown across the centuries. Noting Merian’s unusual concentration on landscape depiction in Atalanta fugiens, Gaudio situates this visual feature within a broader German landscape tradition. Moreover, he suggests, the “background” landscapes in Atalanta fugiens are a commentary on the act of seeing, representing, and measuring nature. This visual mode of engaging nature, Gaudio argues, was an important first step for Maier, preceding the more emblematic act of “looking more deeply” at the foreground images. Just as Maier offers multiple ways of reading, according to Nummedal, so too does he encourage at least two different ways of seeing nature in Atalanta fugiens. Essays by Eric Bianchi and Peter J. Forshaw deepen our understanding of how Maier conceptualized Atalanta fugiens by examining the set of classical and contemporary sources that informed Maier’s use of music and mythology. Eric Bianchi provides us with access to the intellectual context and social milieu of Maier’s musical world in a reconstruction of his musical philosophy. Atalanta fugiens evolved within a multifaceted cultural environment where it participated in lofty mathematical abstractions about cosmic harmony even as it reflected commonplace professional music practices. Maier’s approach to music was thus speculative and performative, and Bianchi’s study navigates between these seemingly opposed cultural forces. He discusses Atalanta fugiens as a work of music theory in terms of the relationship between the “sounded” music in Atalanta fugiens and the “silent” music of Maier’s later work, Cantilenae intellectuales (Intellectual Songs, 1622). As to the performative possibilities of Atalanta fugiens, Bianchi explores how the visual is rendered audible through the musical technique of text painting, or “madrigalisms.” This vocal feature of the music also constitutes an important element of Maier’s sensorial delivery of chymical arcana, pointing to underlying relationships among Maier’s music, image, and text—how the images influenced the fugues, for example, or vice versa. Maier’s use of personifications in his musical scores merge Ovidian characters with alchemical philosophy, and the essay by Peter J. Forshaw presents a rich intertextual examination for understanding Maier’s use of myth in the context of alchemy. Forshaw elucidates a long tradition of alchemical interpretations of ancient myths, the literary genre known as mythoalchemy, which extends from the classical into the early modern period. This historiographical framework sheds new light on Maier’s adaptation of an Ovidian legend as the matrix for Atalanta fugiens. Maier understood hieroglyphs and myths to be transmissions of ancient knowledge and wisdom from the Egyptians to the Greeks, presenting a coded language in which chymical secrets were embedded. Forshaw’s study places Maier’s use of emblems and the Atalanta story in relation to his earlier mythoalchemical work, Arcana arcanissima (Most Secret Secrets, 1614), which Forshaw argues is the core of a mytho-chymical project that plays out across several of Maier’s published works. Atalanta fugiens is thus set within a wider alchemical program in which Maier uses myth and symbols to hide knowledge from the vulgar, yet at the same time to reveal knowledge to the learned. The final group of essays by Loren Ludwig, Richard Oosterhoff, and Donna Bilak explore Maier’s incorporation of music and mathematics into Atalanta fugiens. Loren Ludwig argues that Maier did not, in fact, compose forty of the fifty “fugues” in this musical alchemical emblem book. Ludwig’s musicological analysis of Atalanta fugiens reveals how Maier repurposed a printed collection of choir exercises by the English composer John Farmer, Diuers and sundry waies (1591), thus connecting Atalanta fugiens to earlier English musical and liturgical traditions. Ludwig’s finding recalibrates our understanding of how the “fugues” in Maier’s book support its alchemical program. This raises important questions about authorship and intentionality, as Maier’s adaptation of Farmer’s waies in Atalanta fugiens reframes how we might interpret Maier’s curious integration of music in this book. The essay by Richard Oosterhoff explores Maier’s use of mathematics to support his alchemical agenda. Oosterhoff focuses on Emblem 21, which considers the ancient problem of squaring the circle, arguing that Maier dwells on this mathematical example as a sustained commentary on the creation and transformation of knowledge. According to Oosterhoff, Maier believed that if human knowledge could begin with the divine spark of inspiration, it must also be cultivated through the dedicated and sustained application of reason and experience, not through instinct, imagination, and phantasy. If squaring the circle was one of the most vexing mathematical problems, it was also, according to Oosterhof, an example par excellence of knowledge that was possible, even if not yet attained. In this sense, it became an important model for the possibility of metallic transmutation. At the same time, both desiderata also exposed the tensions, if not contradictions, between what might be possible in theory and in practice. The closing essay presents another viewpoint on Maier’s use of mathematics as a way to probe nature’s secrets. Donna Bilak takes up the question of why Maier configured Atalanta fugiens around fifty fugue-emblem sets, arguing that Maier engineered his musical alchemical emblem book around a concealed mathematical puzzle. Discovery of this puzzle lies in finding and solving clues, “secret signs,” that Maier embedded in the emblems, and doing so effects a numerical transmutation that reshuffles their order. Atalanta fugiens becomes a game based on the reader’s ability to attain new insights about chymical arcana that the contemplation of new emblem groupings prompt, with the book itself serving as an object that hides Maier’s secret game in plain view. Bilak’s analysis of Atalanta fugiens as a steganographic work invites a reading of Maier’s book in terms of cover text and ciphertext, opening up the study of alchemy to contemporary cryptographic practices. Collectively, these seven essays reposition Atalanta fugiens as a blend of theoretical, performative, and practical engagements with nature. Maier is not the artist, nor the musician, but he draws on sound and image, as well as mathematics and myth, to construct an alchemical allegory about the search for health and wealth. Moreover, by reordering, resequencing, or focusing on different elements of Atalanta fugiens each time they opened the book, Maier’s readers could use it to generate almost endless new insights into nature’s secrets. The multiple parts of Atalanta fugiens, as well as the numerous potential ways of reading, seeing, and hearing it, put the book in motion, setting up a hunt for meaning and a dynamic reading practice that transformed it into a complex epistemological tool. At the same time, these essays suggest that Atalanta fugiens is more than an exploration of the synergies, tensions, and intersections among the languages of musical score, copperplate etching, and Latin discourse. Maier may also have intended his book to address shifting anxieties around the early modern disciplines that bridged sense and intellect, theory and practice, scholarship and craft in the early seventeenth century. Music, art, and alchemy grappled with a similar set of tensions. These arts were all framed by theoretical literatures that could be quite abstract and scholarly; as a set of practices, however, they also required knowledge of technique and the material world. The very nature of these mixed arts, therefore, raised questions about whether they were a philosophy, a craft, or a mixture of the two, and how these elements related to one another. These complexities of education, training, praxis, and expertise mirrored social concerns about the position of the alchemist, the artist, and the musician between court, university, and workshop. Perhaps, these essays suggest, Atalanta fugiens placed art, alchemy, music, and, more subtly, mathematics, in conversation because all of these arts grappled with a similar set of issues about the relationships among different forms of expertise, training, and practice in these mixed disciplines. The essays that follow insist that Atalanta fugiens must be understood in its original historical context, as an artifact of its author and his early seventeenth-century world. The meaning of Atalanta fugiens, however, has always been in the hands of its readers, viewers, listeners, and singers. Indeed, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Maier’s contemporaries almost immediately seemed to want to amend, translate, and even disassemble Atalanta fugiens, thereby reimagining its message for new generations. In fact, a constellation of Atalanta-objects began to appear around Maier’s original book already in the seventeenth century, highlighting the desire not simply to sit down and read the text, but rather to repurpose it for new contexts. Some individuals created their own customized copies, presumably for private use. The creators of the copies in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the Donald F. and Mildred Topp Othmer Library of Chemical History, for example, had them hand-colored, turning black and white etchings into verdant landscapes, azure skies, glowing fires, and vibrant, multicolored costumes (figs. 1 and 2). Figure 1 Figure 2 Others replaced Maier’s Latin/German text with French or English translations, copying their new vernacular mottos, epigrams, and discourses—but not, notably, the fugues that originally accompanied them—into private miscellanies alongside other standard works from the centuries-old alchemical corpus (fig. 3). Figure 3 One translator may have had a more public audience in mind for his English version, Atalanta running, that is, new chymicall emblems relating to the secrets of nature, which included the mottos, epigrams, and discourses, but not the images or the music (fig. 4). Now in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, this manuscript looks as if it may have been a fair copy intended for the printing press, rather than a manuscript for private use, and we use it here as the English translation in our digital edition. Figure 4 Yet neither Atalanta running nor any of the other vernacular translations of Atalanta fugiens made it into print in the seventeenth century; instead, they remained in private manuscript collections or perhaps exchanged among friends in the scholarly networks that extended across the early modern intellectual community known as the Republic of Letters. The fact that none of these manuscripts included the music suggests that they may date from the late seventeenth century, possibly modeled on a reconfigured printed version of Maier’s original that appeared in 1687 under a new title: Secretioris naturae secretorum scrutinium chymicum (The Chymical Investigation of the Most Secret Nature of Secrets). The publisher, Georg Heinrich Oehrling, dropped not only Maier’s original title and the vignettes detailing scenes from the Ovidian Atalanta story that framed it, but also one part of each emblem set: the page with the music and the German translations of the Latin mottos and epigrams. These changes radically transformed the book’s original program. In this 1687 edition, Atalanta fugiens was no longer about sound and sight; the reader was no longer also a listener. The removal of the music ended up placing greater emphasis on the emblems and discourses. Like the anonymous authors of the French and English manuscript variants, Oehrling may have had any number of reasons to make these changes, not least of which was the cost of printing music or duplicative German. It had also been about seventy years since Atalanta fugiens first appeared, and the social, intellectual, and political context that had shaped Maier’s original book had changed too. Natural philosophy was increasingly institutionalized in scientific societies and journals, which played a crucial role in determining how (and how not) to write about nature. At the same time, the alchemical middle ground between art, science, literature, and music that Atalanta fugiens occupied had also begun to pull apart. Parts of alchemy were increasingly being reframed as modern chemistry, while others were left behind, or moved out of scientific or medical discourse altogether. These early manuscript and print adaptations suggest that it was often Maier’s text that held the most appeal for his earliest readers, who could sometimes do without the music and even the images. In at least one instance, however, it was the images that held the most appeal. The Bibliotheca Hermetica Philosophica in Amsterdam holds three seventeenth-century oak panels with oil paintings depicting figures from Atalanta fugiens mingling with figures from two other early modern alchemical texts, Basil Valentine’s Practica cum duodecim clavibus (Twelve Keys, 1677) and Johann Daniel Mylius’ Philosophia reformata (Philosophy Reformed, 1622). These intriguing objects allowed the images in these three well-known alchemical texts to float free entirely of the words that once accompanied them, creating new visual schemes that referenced their original contexts only enigmatically and underscored alchemy’s potential as a purely symbolic language. Words without music; images without text. These seventeenth-century adaptations of Maier’s original point to a quality of the book that shaped the responses of even its first readers and which, we argue, has ensured that the book remains of interest today. Assembled out of discrete units of music, image, and text, Atalanta fugiens depends on its combination of media, its appeal to multiple senses, and its promise that only this particular assemblage can serve its aim: namely, to ponder the relationship between the senses and the intellect, and to reveal insights into nature both practical and philosophical. At the same time, the book also encourages its readers to take it apart, to reshuffle, select, and reimagine its elements. It was and is a book in parts, and this fundamental fact continues to inspire and interest users today. Modern readers continue to be drawn to Atalanta fugiens for these reasons, as well as for the book’s beauty, arresting images, music, and enigmatic content. Contemporary artists have drawn on Maier’s imagery to reimagine the form of the book and its images today, while musicians continue to perform, record, and be inspired by the fugues. Browsing for recordings of Maier’s music on Apple’s iTunes Store or on Bandcamp, one can find recordings in period style, as well as electronic and electroacoustic or metal versions. A search for #atalantafugiens on Instagram or Twitter reveals the book’s ongoing appeal to Rosicrucians, alchemists, and others who see it as an important repository of information about alchemical theories, imagery, and texts. The unusual longevity of Atalanta fugiens is certainly noteworthy, raising pressing questions about why and how particular elements of early modern culture continue to resonate with twenty-first-century audiences, while others fade away. Our own digital edition is, in a sense, part of the long afterlife of Atalanta fugiens, and should be understood in this context. These accompanying essays are meant to anchor the edition historically, to frame users’ explorations of Maier’s extraordinary book as a dialogue between Maier’s world and our own. While alchemy is no longer part of modern science, perhaps, it continues to appeal to many as a world we have lost. Some today are drawn to alchemy as a scientific discourse unafraid of reaching for the most profound divine or cosmic wisdom, while others might value Atalanta fugiens for its elevation of play as a productive epistemology, in contrast to our more sober modern science. For our part, we appreciate Atalanta fugiens for the way that it invites readers, viewers, listeners, and singers into an early modern landscape of knowledge, where a singer and an alchemist might have more in common than we might think, and where a golden apple might cause us all to pause, to tarry, and to consider nature’s secrets.

Maier’s authorship of the design, text, and music of each emblem has been central to the critical reception of Atalanta fugiens since, at least, Helen Joy Sleeper’s groundbreaking study of the book in 1938, which sought an organic unity of conception both within each emblem and across the progression of the collection’s fifty emblems. This essay will detail my recent discovery that the lion’s share of Atalanta fugiens’ fugues were not composed by Michael Maier. Rather, forty of the collection’s fifty fugues had been published in 1591 in London by the composer John Farmer as Diuers & sundry waies of two parts in one. Only ten of the fifty fugues formerly ascribed to Maier were likely composed by the German alchemist, whose command of the complexities of canonic composition appears not quite equal to his facility with Latin poetics and mastery of the alchemical corpus. Where and how did Maier encounter Farmer’s obscure book of canons? And why did he choose to adapt an old-fashioned and esoteric English musical idiom to his erudite emblem book? As we will explore in subsequent pages, the discovery of the true authorship of Maier’s fugues raises numerous historical and interpretive questions that have the potential to reframe how we read (and sing and hear) Atalanta fugiens’ alchemical music. List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography Music in Atalanta fugiens (1618) In Atalanta fugiens’ opening pages, Maier explains how the fifty alchemical fugues support the collection’s complex and multivalent alchemical program: Canon (Maier’s fuga) (literally “rule”) A polyphonic musical form in which an initial melody is imitated at a specified time interval by one or more parts, either at the unison (i.e., the same pitch) or at some other pitch. A round is a type of canon, but in a round each voice, when it finishes, can start at the beginning again so that the piece can go “round and round,” as with “Frère Jacques” or “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.” Note that the Italian term fuga, as used by Maier, is not interchangeable with the modern term “fugue.” Rather, fuga, borrowed from Renaissance music theorist and composer Gioseffo Zarlino, was the preferred term for “canon” in German-speaking lands. In order to convey the most striking representations of this race, My Muse gives me fugues in three-fold voice. One simple voice remains and lingers to represent the apple, While the second voice is fleeing, and the third dutifully follows. The Emblems presents themselves to your eyes, as the fugue does to your ears, But let your Reason strive for the arcane interpretations. The personification of Atalanta, Hippomenes and the golden apples (Pomum morans) as, respectively, the leading voice, the following voice and the cantus firmus of each fugue is enlisted by Maier to evoke the three key elements of transmutational alchemy (mercury, sulfur, and salt), as well as three stages of the alchemical process (nigredo, albedo, and rubedo). By the early seventeenth century the alchemical corpus had thoroughly digested both an allegorical conception of the holy Trinity and a parallel Hermetic narrative that traced alchemy’s deep roots in three-fold assemblages to Hermes Trismegistus, literally “thrice-greatest” Hermes. Had Maier been aware of the identity of the cantus firmus—the second phrase of the Kyrie trope Cunctipotens genitor Deus (All-Powerful Creator)—on which John Farmer based the canons that Maier transformed into Atalanta fugiens’ fugues, Maier might have appreciated the resonance between the fugues as they appeared in Atalanta fugiens and the Kyrie itself (with its threefold repetition of its three statements). Over the course of the last century, numerous scholars have sought to explain Maier’s nuanced vision of music’s role in alchemical gnosis. Though historians have identified several points of contact between surviving writings on alchemy and early modern musical sources, Atalanta fugiens’ fifty fugues represent a unique and unparalleled confluence. The central concerns of previous scholarship on Atalanta fugiens’ music have been the role of music in Maier’s cosmography—especially in relation to classical sources on music such as Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Boethius—and the identification of potential musical antecedents of the fugues (such as the origin of the ubiquitous cantus firmus melody, and contemporaneous theoretical writings on music by, for example, Johannes Lippius and Sethus Calvisius). Hildemarie Streich’s voluminous prefatory essay in Joscelyn Godwin’s 1989 translation of Atalanta fugiens’ offers, as do several earlier treatments, close readings of various fugues seeking to map specific musical features to particular emblems’ programs, as well as to the trajectory of the book as a whole. In nearly all cases, scholars have stumbled over obvious inconsistencies in the quality of the collection’s fifty compositions. Cantus Firmus (or Plainsong) A slow moving voice in a polyphonic musical texture, often comprised of a preexistent liturgical melody to which a composer has added newly-composed voices. As Jacques Rebotier has documented, Maier’s published corpus reveals something of a fixation on music in triparte constructions, a fact that has not eluded music historians seeking early sources on the musical triad. Maier’s Symbola aureae mensae (Symbols of the Golden Table, 1617), Jocus severus (A Severe Joke, 1617), and Cantilenae intellectuales (Intellectual Songs, 1622) all contain passages on music, though no comprehensive scholarly treatment of music in Maier’s substantial corpus currently exists. Unlike the highly figurative Cantilenae intellectuales, in which a different poetic text is assigned to each of the three musical “voices” (acuta, media, and gravis) of each “song,” Atalanta fugiens’ fugues are notated music that could certainly have been sung. Maier’s instructions in Atalanta fugiens’ title specify that he intended the volume’s contents “be seen, read, meditated, Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard,” and in most (though not all) cases the layout of canonic material on the page allows for real-time performance. On the other hand, Maier’s association in Cantilenae intellectuales of a constellation of references to the “silence” of musica speculativa with “the (alchemical) micro-world, comprising, as it does, three natures expressed as three voices (high-pitched, medium and bass)” suggests that a sensitive reader of Atalanta fugiens might hear quite a lot in the silent contemplation of Maier’s musical notation. In general terms, Atalanta fugiens’ fugues support the book’s alchemical program in at least two important ways. First, the fugues provide a musical representation of Atalanta’s race with Hippomenes, the book’s master trope that Maier freights with layers of alchemical allegory. Second, vocal chamber music serves as a figure for the sociality Maier sought to cultivate with his alchemical emblem book. Assuming that the fugues were actually sung (an assumption I examine in more detail below), they would have required the presence of at least three singers, a quorum of participants that evokes the sociality of alchemical practices in courts, artisanal workshops, and chymical clubs. Relatedly, if Maier intended Atalanta fugiens as a showpiece of erudition designed to secure him a new patron, his inclusion of accessible but sophisticated vocal chamber music was a wise—if ultimately unsuccessful—stratagem. The Waies Tradition and John Farmer John Farmer (b. ca. 1570; fl. 1591–1601) is known to scholars of English Renaissance music from his numerous four-part settings in Thomas East’s psalter of 1592, his First Set of English Madrigals (1600), and his contribution to the very popular madrigal anthology dedicated to Elizabeth I, the Triumphs of Oriana (1601). Less well known is Farmer’s first publication, Diuers & sundry waies of two parts in one, to the number of fortie, vppon one playnsong (henceforth Sundry waies), published “in youth” in 1591 and dedicated to Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, in whose household Farmer may have lived for several years (fig. 1). John Farmer of Leicester and a “generous family” matriculated at Oxford’s Merton College on March 27, 1584, aged eighteen. Farmer next appears as an organist and master of choristers at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, a position he began on February 1, 1595 and held until, likely, 1599 when he returned to London. Figure 1 Plainsong canons, or waies (as they appear in Farmer’s title), were central to the musical culture that surrounded John Farmer during the final decades of the sixteenth century. Thomas Morley’s discussion of waies in his Plaine and easie introduction to practicall musicke (1597) stretches to ten full pages with numerous musical examples, including waies by Morley himself, William Byrd, and Osbert Parsley. Morley’s treatise, dedicated to “the most excellent musitian maister William Byrde,” synthesizes much sixteenth-century musical learning from across Europe and remains a touchstone of music theory and compositional practice of the period. Morley, who graduated BMus from Oxford in 1588, was one of a circle musicians who composed and improvised waies (and almost certainly used them in their teaching) during the 1580s and 90s when the idiom was something of a fad among a community of Catholic composers that included Byrd, John Bull, William Bathe, Elway Bevin, and Alfonso Ferrabosco I. Surviving sources of waies share an impressive breadth of canonic technique, including a systematic display of canons at different temporal and musical intervals. They also rely on a surprisingly small number of plainsong cantus firmi, the most popular by far being the Miserere mihi.

The particular version of the plainsong used by Farmer is a near perfect match with the Kyrie IV melody as it was first printed in the Sarum graduale during the middle of the fifteenth century. Kyrie 1V melody in Sarum Graduale 1508 Farmer Sundry waies Figure 2 In her 1938 article, Sleeper identified Kyrie IV as the source of the Pomum morans melody in Atalanta fugiens’ fugues, though her assumption (shared by subsequent scholars) that Maier was their composer introduced some confusion about how that particular melody might have found its way onto the pages of Maier’s book. In the 1573 edition of the Istitutioni (first edition 1558), perhaps the most influential composition treatise across late sixteenth-century Europe, Gioseffo Zarlino provides a plainsong canon that uses the first phrase of Kyrie IV, and in Melopoeia (1592), the German theorist Sethus Calvisius introduced the second phrase of Kyrie IV (the same melody that appears in Farmer and subsequently in Maier) in his discussion of canon. Whether Maier initially encountered Kyrie IV in Zarlino or in Calvisius (who is widely credited with transmitting Zarlino’s ideas to German lands), or perhaps somewhere else, remains a matter of speculation. As Giuseppe Gerbino has documented, there was some continental interest during the early seventeenth century in plainsong canon, which Gerbino refers to, following Zarlino, as contrappunto obbligato. For our purposes, though, given that Maier chose to appropriate an English composer’s waies built on an English variant of Kyrie IV, I will focus my discussion on waies in the English context. The popularity of waies among English musicians during the late sixteenth century has remained something of a mystery. A miniature form seemingly designed to showcase abstruse contrapuntal machinations, waies proliferated at a moment when the text-driven expressivity and larger forms of the seconda prattica were ascendant in England. With a few notable exceptions, forthright, largely homophonic psalm and hymn settings were displacing centuries of complex polyphony as the musical vehicle for the (now Protestant) liturgy. Waies typically feature two parts in canon accompanied by (or accompanying) a liturgical chant excerpt used as a pfundnote cantus firmus, a slow-moving melody in long notes of unvarying length. Canon 01 Canon 13 Canon 19a Canon 25 Canon 39 Waies typically feature two parts in canon accompanied by (or accompanying) a liturgical chant excerpt used as a pfundnote cantus firmus, a slow-moving melody in long notes of unvarying length. The tradition of sacralizing a liturgical melody by garlanding it with polyphonic accompaniment had been central to European composition for hundreds of years. However, the wholesale, violent reorganization of the liturgy by English Reformers meant that the melodies and associated Latin texts of the Sarum Rite—the dominant rite in Southern England prior to the Reformation—were no longer in common use. The appearance of Sarum chant melodies in waies published during some of the most intensely anti-Catholic years of Elizabeth I’s reign suggests that their use as cantus firmi was more than incidental. At the very least, the use of such melodies as the Miserere mihi and Cunctipotens genitor Deus by waies composers gestured to an earlier musical era when musical canon was strongly associated with ritual symbolism, a tradition that persisted in various forms through at least the early seventeenth century. However, the use of Sarum melodies as cantus firmi in the waies corpus suggests that composers of waies were interested not just in the tradition of polyphony as a ritual enhancement of the musical Word as expressed in now-outlawed Sarum chant melodies, but in the particular Catholic associations of the melodies themselves. Yet even if we accept the notion that waies composition was partly motivated by an attraction to Sarum chant, myriad questions remain. Why were these collections published? Who was their intended audience, and how did their authors envision their use? And how and why was the Lutheran Maier drawn to the waies idiom as a source for Atalanta fugiens’ music? The contrapuntal virtuosity that characterizes the waies corpus, with its encyclopedic treatments of canonic possibility, suggests that the display of compositional skill was at least a factor in the circulation and publication of waies. Yet the most ostentatious feature of the waies corpus—its stubborn reliance on bits of plainchant associated with a forbidden ritual practice—is incidental to its displays of compositional complexity. After all, composers eager to display contrapuntal cunning could just as easily have composed canons not on a plainsong, or could have chosen popular melodies or scalar patterns as the basis of their waies. Eamon Duffy famously documented the crisis of the sudden proscription of familiar rites following several waves of violent religious reform, the extent to which “the Reformation was a stripping away of familiar and beloved observances, the destruction of a vast and resonant world of symbols.” Despite strenuous official efforts to purge the country of Catholic ritual artefacts—missals, books of hours, vestments, rood screens, “idolatrous” images, etc.—a surprising number of such ritual items were saved by enterprising clergy and parishioners. Many such items, as Duffy chronicles, either retained their ritual significance as part of the surreptitious and piecemeal practice of those who resisted Reformers’ efforts, or they were stripped of some or all of their former ritual power to become incorporated into the new structures of belief and practice. One such ritual vestige of the old religion to survive the Reformation in various, not altogether unrecognizable forms was a selection of plainchant melodies of the Sarum Rite, a formerly enormous corpus that had served as the core of the musical liturgy for centuries. Stripped of their incriminating Latin texts, these melodies appear frequently in Elizabethan music, often in self-consciously antiquated musical forms, such as the In nomine for ensembles of viols, that harken back to a sacralizing pre-Reformation musical sensibility. It is perhaps no coincidence that a preponderance of the Elizabethan polyphony that makes use of plainchant melodies (in both their texted and untexted forms) was composed by musicians who had chosen to maintain ties—often at great personal and professional expense—to the old religion. The waies idiom emerged out of a community of just such composers, musicians who managed—using varied strategies and with varying degrees of success—to preserve professional identities as composers in a virulently anti-Catholic culture while creating music that gestured in a range of ways towards their confessional allegiance. Considered as an adjunct to the education of choristers, waies publications—including Farmer’s Sundry waies—would have offered flexible teaching materials and variously coded gestures to venerated musical and liturgical traditions that had only been papered over by the new psalters and prayer book. There is no evidence that Farmer harbored Catholic sympathies, yet as a musician with many connections to the liturgy he would have been aware of the persistent ritual and musical absences of the new official religion as well as, most likely, the extent to which proscribed practices lay everywhere beneath the surface. Singing Farmer’s waies, for example, would have quickly lodged in the memory the excerpt of the Cunctipotens genitor Deus chant melody on which Farmer based his canons and that appears at the top of each page of Sundry waies. Singing and memorizing chant had been the principal occupation of choristers for centuries, and though Farmer’s collection is purportedly focused on canonic composition, that fact is that accessing its lessons requires a repetition and memorization of a Sarum chant melody that would have offered Elizabethan musicians multiple registers of continuity with the past. That the waies corpus may have been a vehicle for educating choristers about how to sing—as opposed to compose—liturgical polyphony is further suggested by the nearly complete absence in any treatise (aside from Morley’s) of the sort of nuts-and-bolts compositional strategies that we see in, for example, Zarlino’s Istitutioni. Virtually all the known composers of waies served as masters of choristers (Farmer held such a position in Ireland after he graduated from Oxford and published Sundry waies), whose responsibilities included training students to sing the high-pitched “treble” and “mean” vocal parts essential to the musical liturgy. A master of choristers needed musical exercises to train his charges, exercises that could serve the mix of vocal ranges and skill levels possessed by a motley group of choristers ranging in age from six or seven years old to the late teenage years. Farmer’s collection of canons would have offered a valuable set of exercises in singing and playing notated polyphony as well as graded models for aspiring composers. Sundry waies is organized by clef grouping (fig. 3), providing a collection of pieces that fairly evenly distribute the plainsong and the leading and following canonic voices through all possible vocal and instrumental ranges. Of the collection’s forty canons, there are examples that would comfortably fit the vocal ranges of any possible combination of three singers, from the highest treble to the lowest bass possessed by an older boy who had not yet found a place as an adult singing man. Alternately, students playing any combination of the three traditional sizes of viol could have found a canon to practice reading different clefs and performing simple polyphony together. In one scenario, the teacher might have used the leading voice of a particular waie to model solmization and style while students performed the following voice and supported the proceedings with the cantus firmus. Alternatively, two advanced students or groups of students might have sung the canonic voices while the teacher reinforced good rhythm and intonation through his performance of the accompanying plainsong. Farmer’s Sundry waies could also have served as a veritable encyclopedia of canonic techniques for advanced students learning to compose imitative polyphony or improvise counterpoint against a cantus firmus. Waies’ conventional absence of texts would have facilitated the use of the hexachordal syllables—ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la—by young singers developing their solmization skills. Music of known pedagogical intent from the same period and publisher features both texted and untexted exercises in a similar bid for maximal flexibility. Counterpoint (adj. Contrapuntal) A compositional technique forming the basis of Western musical practice in which multiple voices are composed so as to control the consonance and dissonance of the intervals between their individual constituent notes. Polyphony A musical texture characterized by multiple, simultaneous, independent musical voices. Waies 1–18 Waies 19-40 Figure 3 The surviving waies corpus (see Table 1, “waies sources”) testifies to a brief but intense fascination with this esoteric idiom. The purported educational value of waies as an aid to teaching composition and/or performance does not seem adequate to explain the seemingly obsessive generation of dozens or hundreds of short canons to just a couple short snippets of ancient plainsong. The Catholic sympathies of nearly all the known composers of waies (Farmer notwithstanding), as well as the conspicuous choice of cantus firmi drawn from a proscribed rite, suggest that the idiom may have served retrospective or symbolic—alongside musical—purposes to its small community of enthusiasts. The combinatory fervor evident in what appear to have been somewhat systematic attempts to present all the possible canons against a given cantus firmus may have been an English take on similarly ideologically charged combinatory efforts by various Jesuit thinkers (among them Cristoph Clavius and, later, Athanasius Kircher) on the continent. What is certainly true is that the English waies corpus brought people together to sing, play, or compose, to learn, practice, or worship, in moments of collaborative musical intimacy. Maier’s Adaptation of Farmer’s Waies Atalanta fugiens’ presentation of Farmer’s waies is legible as imitation, the strategic concealing and revealing of different sources to different readers, all in the context of the broader problem of publishing alchemical secrets while reserving core truths for the initiated reader. Maier’s close connection to Jacobean England—his visits to the court during 1611–1616, his publication in London of the Arcana arcanissima (Most Secret Secrets, 1614), Atalanta fugiens’ silent transmission of an English musical form, etc.—contributes to an emerging reevaluation of the influence of English culture on the continent during the first decades of the seventeenth century. Karin Figala and Ulrich Neumann have identified several notable Englishmen to whom Maier wrote personal dedications in surviving copies of the Arcana arcanissima. One, Sir William Paddy (1554–1634), personal physician to James I, is of interest as the potential vector of Farmer’s Sundry waies to Maier. Paddy was an amateur musician associated throughout his life with Oxford, having graduated from St. John’s College and later leaving his estate, including an organ and £1800 “for the improvement of the choir,” to St. John’s. While John Farmer had matriculated to Merton College, a few blocks away, William Bathe, a Catholic composer of waies who is quoted by Maier in Atalanta fugiens’ introduction, had been a student at St. John’s during the 1580s and would have likely known both Farmer and Paddy. It is also possible that Maier encountered Farmer’s Sundry waies on the continent; dances by Farmer appear in Thomas Simpson’s Opusculum neuwer Pavanen, published in Heidelberg in 1610, so the composer was not entirely unknown in Maier’s Germany. However Maier got his hands on Farmer’s collection of waies, he left a few breadcrumbs in Atalanta fugiens that hint at the depth of his engagement with the English waies tradition. Atalanta fugiens’ preface reveals unmistakable references both to Farmer’s preface in Sundry waies and to the epigraph and preface (“To the Reader”) from William Bathe’s waies collection, A briefe introduction to the skill of song (c. 1596). Additionally, one or more of Maier’s emblems (6 and 42, for example) may slyly gesture towards his surreptitious repurposing of Farmer’s canons. Compare Emblems Farmer Collection Add to Emblem Collections A careful reading of Farmer’s prefatory essay “Philomusicis” alongside Maier’s praefatio reveals multiple points of contact, from the parallel treatment—in roughly the same order—of the themes of divine omniscience and the hierarchy of knowledge as represented by the seven liberal arts, to specific citations and turns of phrase. Though some similarities are no doubt due to both authors’ employment of a richly conventional tradition of prefatory address, specific references in both prefaces to the story of Themistocles, for example, and his famed inability to play the lyre appear too specific to be easily explained by coincidence or convention. This is true also of both Farmer’s and Maier’s distinctive rhetoric asserting that their respective arts (Farmer’s music and Maier’s chymistry) are “not the last, if not the first,” (Farmer) or “not the meanest, but next to . . . divine things, the principal and most precious of all,” (Maier) in the hierarchy of knowledge.

The title page of Bathe’s Briefe introduction features an epigram ascribed to “Fabius”—presumably Marcus Fabius Quintilianus—whose writings on rhetoric and music were a standard part of an English gentleman’s education in the liberal arts. Quintilian’s Institutio oratoria (Institutes of Oratory), in fact, is a likely source of the story about Themistocles cited by Farmer and Maier. Bathe’s epigram, “music is an honest and agreeable recreation, most worthy of liberal and learned persons,” does not appear in any of Quintilian’s known writings, nor was I able to find it in a fairly exhaustive search of classical sources on music known in England during the sixteenth century. Where it does appear, however, similarly (and perhaps erroneously) ascribed to “Fabius,” is in Maier’s praefatio, where it concludes Maier’s discussion of music as a key element in Atalanta fugiens’ multi-modal conception. It would appear that Maier was familiar, therefore, not just with Farmer’s collection of waies but also with Bathe’s, suggesting that Maier’s selection of Farmer’s canons was an informed and considered choice. One extraordinary feature of Bathe’s Briefe introduction is the inclusion of a tabular algorithm for the composition of waies—a sort of paint-by-number technique for composing canons “to the plainsong.” It is possible that Maier used Bathe’s table to help him compose the ten fugues he likely contributed to Atalanta fugiens, though it would be difficult to know for certain. It is more probable that Maier closely (though imperfectly) imitated Farmer’s examples, which were likely not composed with the aid of Bathe’s algorithm. The paradigmatic alterations Maier made to Farmer’s canons can be expressed quite simply: Maier transposed all of Farmer’s canons up a fourth, set to them the Latin epigrams that appear beneath as part of each emblem, and scrambled the order in which Farmer had presented his canons in Sundry waies (see Table 2). In order to make the Latin words fit music for which they weren’t initially conceived, Maier freely broke long notes into shorter values, particularly the semibreves that comprise the cantus firmus, or Pomum morans in his Atalantan conception of the pieces. In all cases, only the first of the three verses of each epigram underlays the music, which is printed—like Farmer’s canons—in choirbook format on one page. In his Melopoeia of 1592, the German music theorist and astronomer Calvisius articulated a rationale for adding text to textless music that calls to mind Maier’s exhortation to his readers that “The Emblems presents themselves to your eyes, as the fugue does to your ears, But let your Reason strive for the arcane interpretations.” Calvisius writes, although a bare [textless] harmony such as is found in instrumental music, when intelligently and skillfully wrought by an artist, may reach men’s minds by virtue of its numbers and proportions and exert great power in arousing the affections, nevertheless, if one adds a human voice which at the same time sings a significant idea portrayed in harmonic numbers, the melody will become much more elevated, more welcome both to the ears and to the mind, because of the twofold delight which the harmony and the noble idea will engender. Maier was a gifted epigrammatist, and perhaps couldn’t resist “elevating” Farmer’s enticingly “bare harmony” with the addition of “noble ideas.” For those readers eager to identify connections among the elements of a given emblem (the fuga, engraving, epigram, and discursus), comparing Farmer’s and Maier’s tables of contents may suggest which fugues are most likely to reward close reading. Those series of emblems in which Maier scrambled Farmer’s order (in order to align salient musical features with related themes in the accompanying engraving, epigram, or discursus) are likely richer in intra-emblematic connections than those series where Maier simply reproduced Farmer’s canons in their original order. For example, for emblems 22–29 and 35–40, Maier used Farmer’s canons in the same order he encountered them in Farmer’s collection. In contrast, Maier carefully selected the most complex and evocative of Farmer’s canons for his final ten fugues. It is in these final ten fugues that musical details of a particular fugue can most easily be interpreted to manifest the overarching themes of the emblem to which it belongs. Emblem 46, for example, titled “Two Eagles come together, one from the East, the other from the West,” features an engraving of Jupiter holding an eagle in each hand and is accompanied by this epigram (fig. 4) Great Jove two Eagles out of Delphi sent To the East and Western parts, for this intent, That he the middle of the earth might find; Which, there returning, well resolved his mind. But those two Eagles are two stones, which have One from the East, the other from the West. Figure 4 Add to Collection Maier chose Farmer’s canon 38, a retrograde canon in which the canonic voices proceed, in Farmer’s words, “ . . . backward and forward, the one part to begin at the beginning and so [to] the ende, and the other part to begin at the ende, and so forward to the beginning, the plainsong likewise, is to be sung forward and backward . . . ” The image of two eagles flying in opposite directions and then returning is echoed in (or echoes) a performance of the fugue, in which the two canonic parts read the same line from opposite directions and the cantus firmus is “out of Delphi sent,” and then returns to its starting point. The first twenty fugues present another snapshot of Maier’s process of adapting Farmer’s canons to Atalanta fugiens. Of the first twenty fugues, the odd-numbered ones (1–19) do not appear in Farmer’s Sundry waies. Circumstantial evidence points to Maier as the composer of these pieces, which imitate Farmer’s canons while exhibiting substantially less contrapuntal facility. A close look at the odd-numbered fugues 1–19 reveals myriad contrapuntal errors of numerous sorts. Fuga 1, the opening piece of the collection, for example, is rife with infelicities that include parallel perfect intervals, improperly handled dissonances, and melodic tritones. In their theoretical writings on the composition of waies back in England, both Morley and Bathe described a method that entails first composing a canon in whole notes against the cantus firmus, and then introducing diminutions in the canonic voices (fig. 5). Figure 5 Each of these two phases of the composition of waies entails its own set of skills to master and invites its own distinctive errors. The fugues that originated as Farmer’s canons exhibit orthodox treatment of consonance and dissonance, and inventive diminutions to create frequent suspensions, syncopations, and melodic interest through the use of varying rhythmic values. The fugues I ascribe to Maier, on the other hand, include frequent contrapuntal errors that originate at the structural, canonic level (fig. 6) as well as those introduced in the diminutions. The fugues by Maier also reveal significant confusion about the use of musica ficta, the chromatic alteration of melody in response to contrapuntal exigencies that was an essential skill for literate musicians. Fugues 5, 9, and 11, for example, present numerous errors that are representative of Maier’s evident confusion about the correct application of ficta. Figure 6 Existing scholarship on the music in Atalanta fugiens has had to account for the curious inconsistency of quality evident in the fugues. It is now clear the forty fugues that originated as canons by John Farmer meet the period’s professional standards of composition, while the remaining ten fugues are evidently the work of an ambitious amateur attempting to imitate Farmer’s well-wrought models. The only surviving composition that can (somewhat) dependably be ascribed to Maier is a waie, featuring four canonic voices over a repeating cantus firmus, that was included in a Christmas greeting presented to James I in 1611 while Maier was in England acting as an ambassador for Frederick, Elector Palatine. Adam McLean, who discovered the letter in the Scottish Records Office, noted that Maier’s Christmas greeting included a Rosicrucian-themed illustration paired with a Latin poem and a piece of music, a combination that prefigures Atalanta fugiens’ emblems. Like the fugues that would appear nearly a decade later, each voice of Maier’s canon for King James is matched to a character: in this case, the four archangels and two shepherds described elsewhere in the letter are designated to sing the four canonic voices and the cantus firmus, respectively. Also like the fugues not by Farmer in Atalanta fugiens, Maier’s Christmas canon is rife with contrapuntal infelicities including unprepared dissonances, melodic tritones, parallel fourths in exposed voices, and awkward voice leading. While it is certainly possible that a different amateur composer completed the ten fugues in Atalanta fugiens not composed by Farmer, the familiarity of the types of errors and Maier’s evident interest in composing waies nearly a decade before the publication of his alchemical emblem book strongly suggest that Atalanta fugiens’ poorly executed examples were composed by Maier himself. Figure 7 Emblem 6, “Sow your gold in the white foliated earth,” features an engraving depicting a farmer sowing gold coins in a freshly tilled field (fig. 7), an alchemical adaptation of a conventional image that would be familiar to early modern readers as the \"parable of the sower.\" Atalanta's engraver, Matthäus Merian, would return to the iconography later in his career with the plate for his illustrated bible. The image in Atalanta's emblem 6, however, appears to owe a debt to the image by the Weirix family of engravers that appeared in devotional publications by the Jesuit Jerome Nadal from the 1580s. The Weirix image (fig. 8) features similarities in the posture and costume of the \"farmer,\" as well as compositional resonances (such as the placement of the tree at the left of the frame and the centrally located church steeple) that likely cannot be explained solely by convention. Figure 8 To a reader aware of Maier’s unacknowledged musical debt and sensitive to the technique of dispersio information—the widespread strategy among alchemical writers of concealing key information by strategically dispersing it throughout a work or corpus—an emblem featuring a “farmer” invites additional scrutiny. Do the field’s furrows look a bit like the lines on a musical staff, and do the gold coins sown by the farmer evoke the sequences of whole notes of a plainsong? Perhaps. Emblem 6 treats the densely intertwined symbology of agriculture and alchemy, a tradition with no shortage of precedent in the alchemical corpus that Maier expounds upon in the discursus. Until, that is, the last several lines, in which Maier veers unexpectedly away from an erudite meditation on how metals “grow” in the earth to a seemingly unrelated discussion of music. For if Music adorned [Achilles], why may it not also make this our work more complete and acceptable: For the Angels sing (as the sacred scriptures attest), the heavens sing, as Pythagoras affirms, and, as the Psalmist says, declare the glory of God, the Muses and Apollo sing, as the Poets, men even infants sing, birds sing, Sheep and geese sing in musical instruments, if therefore we also sing, there is reason for it. It seems unlikely that Maier expected his readers to draw a connection between Emblem 6 and an English composer little known in Germany. Yet his abrupt peroration, in which he furnishes an answer to one of Atalanta fugiens’ most persistent questions (“Why music?”) to conclude an otherwise entirely unmusical emblem, might give a reader pause to consider Maier’s meta-commentary on his own work as an editor and compiler. Though Atalanta fugiens’ printed fugues tell a story about Maier’s appropriation of an esoteric musical idiom to his alchemical program, it’s important to remember that Maier would likely have encountered Farmer’s waies as sounding music, as an audible trace of an interaction among three musicians crowded around a copy of Sundry waies. As they were printed by East, in a choirbook format featuring the plainsong across the top of the page with each of the canonic voices printed start to finish beneath it, Farmer’s canons require one musician per part (three in total) to perform. They would be extremely difficult for even the most skilled keyboard player to read at sight, and harder still for a musician to “audiate”—to hear in his/her head—given how they appear on the page. By way of contrast, consider Morley’s waies (fig. 5), printed in score in his Plaine and easie introduction in order to facilitate the study and performance of all three parts by one student. The music is not the notation—Farmer’s waies are not (just) the three lines of music on each page of his treatise or the abstract set of canonic relationships the notation specifies; rather, they are brief scripted encounters that bring three individual musicians into a focused proximity, both physical (as they crowd around the book) and musical (through imitation and a preponderance of closely voiced intervals). Maier almost certainly would have discovered Farmer’s waies through his performance of them with—presumably—two friends in an English music room, an experience he may have sought to offer to Atalanta fugiens’ readership. Figure 5 The several centuries that separate modern scholarship from Maier and his readers have also seen a shift away from oral performance—reading or singing aloud—towards silent, individual contemplation of the written word or note. Maier’s poetics in the Cantilenae intellectuals about silence as “music, audible only to philosophers” notwithstanding, Atalanta fugiens’ fugues were likely conceived of primarily as sounding things, as short, ritual enactments of the same underlying universal order that the book’s chymistry was meant to reveal. Like the clockwork planetaria that Rudolf II collected in Prague castle (in 1609 Maier entered Rudolf’s court as physician and counselor), the fugues offer the most to the senses when they are in motion, when the harmonious relationships they dramatize play out in real time. As Maier states in Atalanta fugiens’ praefatio, “nothing is said to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense, the understanding of a man new born being supposed as a smooth table, wherein nothing is as yet written, but anything may be written by the help of sense, as a styl[us].” The “sound” of the fugues, as well as the accompanying sensory intensity of singing imitative polyphony as three characters in an Ovidian drama, may well have been a “stylus” with which Maier sought to inscribe the “most abstruse Chymical things, and lastly most rare Musical things to be enucleated by the understanding” on his readers’ intellects. Farmer’s waies, though designed to serve in a very different musical milieu—the small-group pedagogy of choristers in what remained of the choral institutions under Elizabeth I—were accessible only through performance by multiple musicians. It may have been the close choreography of Farmer’s polyphony—its capacity to stage a harmonious, intimate interaction among musical bodies—as much as its contrapuntal subtlety that drew Maier to Farmer’s canons. Though not Catholic, Farmer was close enough to the dispossessed community of Catholic musicians who created the waies idiom to have absorbed some of its ritual element—the quasi-liturgical unfolding of imitative lines against a hypnotic, inexorable bit of plainchant. This ritual intensity may be part of what Maier sought to import into Atalanta fugiens, transforming it to serve the book’s ludic, quasi-mystical ends. The idea that Maier was drawn to the particular ritual intensity of waies (that he had perhaps experienced in England when he first sang or played them) also helps explain the sometimes seemingly random distribution of Farmer’s compositions in Atalanta fugiens. For if Maier included fugues in his alchemical emblem book as a way of intensifying the sensory and social dimensions of reading through the ritual intimacy of polyphonic music making, the exact mapping of a given fugue to the other elements of the emblem becomes a subsidiary consideration. Interpretive Vistas The fact that we now know that eighty percent of Atalanta fugiens’ fugues were conscripted from a publication with a radically different program—that of training English choristers in the performance and composition of counterpoint and promulgating a distinctively English retrospective musical mysticism—offers an opportunity to reorient Atalanta fugiens’ music with regard to its relationships to the book’s other elements. It also suggests critical vistas that include both the intratextuality of each emblem’s different elements and the myriad relationships between Maier’s erudite multimedia project and the rich circulation of sources and ideas across national and religious borders. At stake in evaluating Maier’s musical abilities has been a determination of the appropriate interpretive and critical responses to Atalanta fugiens’ multimedia emblems. Scholars (including Sleeper, Streich, and Manfred Kelkel) who have been willing to overlook the curious and diverse errors that populate the fugues have pursued a close reading of canonic procedure to elucidate the emblems’ alchemical programs. Such work assumes—incorrectly, as we now know—that specific compositional choices are mappable to the textual and visual details of a given emblem’s accompanying elements (the epigram, engraving, and discursus). Latent in this approach is a prioritizing of the textual and visual elements—the notion that the “essence” of a given emblem lies primarily in its visual and textual elements (the epigram and discursus) and that the fugue, like the accompanying engraving, serves to gloss and enrich it. The question of whether the fugues were intended to be actually sung is circumscribed by this issue of priority: the meanings that might emerge from an act of silent contemplation, or amidst the messy exigencies of crowding around the small book to sing, are inevitably tied to beliefs about how the music drives or is driven by the meanings of an emblem’s other elements. The modern embrace of Atalanta fugiens as a multimedia text has been complicated by uncertainties about how involved Maier was in the conception and realization of the engravings, and by persistent doubts about his ability as composer, to say nothing of the complexity and opacity of the book’s overarching alchemical program. An alternative critical project might be to observe how Atalanta fugiens’ identity as a multimedia text depends as much on the competition that emerges among its visual, textual, musical, and chymical elements. The priorities of epigrammatic poetry, engraving, canonic counterpoint, and experimental chemistry cannot always be aligned, and many of the ludic qualities of Maier’s unique collection of emblems might be seen as epiphonema of the interpretive “noise” emitted by this competition. Such a reading would be attentive to the idiomatic—and idiosyncratic—priorities of each separate element before attempting to domesticate their details to their shared program or explain away the details that don’t seem to “fit.” Recovering Maier’s intentions for how the various elements of each emblem combine to reveal the “treasures here enclosed” may be beyond the reach of modern criticism, and attempting such a recovery may be beside the point. Maier invited his readers, I believe, to seek their own meanings amid the rich and complex musical, textual, visual, and chymical interpretations that emerge with the thoughtful engagement of each element within each emblem and across the collection as a whole. Such engagement can take many forms, of course, from silent and solitary reading to convivial—perhaps even raucous—group play. In this context, Maier’s sly inclusion of Farmer’s canons cannot but underline the shared legacy of music and alchemy as social and embodied practices.

First and foremost, Maier’s title page offers up a story (fig. 1). The etchings tell the tale of Atalanta, Hippomenes, and a trio of apples, while the title itself, Atalanta fleeing, puts Atalanta in motion, thereby inviting the reader to follow her flight to the final pages of the book. Even as the title page (literally) frames Maier’s masterpiece with a straightforward visual narrative, however, it immediately suggests a very different mode of reading as well. “Accommodated partly to the eyes and understanding [intellectus]. . . partly to the ears and recreation of the mind,” Maier’s title continues, the “New Chymical Emblems relating to the secrets of nature” within were “to be seen, read, meditated [upon], Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard.” With this subtitle, then, Maier underscores the fact that Atalanta fugiens is also a collection of emblems, a genre that demands of its reader not flight and forward motion, but pause, lingering, and stillness. Moreover, the emblematic mode of reading demands multiple senses: not just the intellect or eyes, but also (in this case) the voice and ears. In his “Preface to the Reader,” Maier points to the potential rewards of reading in these complicated ways, expressing his wish that “the learned have these figures in good estimation which are so useful and serviceable both to the understanding and many of the senses, that great utility besides delight and recreation may be expected from them.” Figure 1 Add to Collection We might think of these two modes of reading as horizontal and vertical. The horizontal mode encourages the reader to turn the page, reading sequentially in search of a narrative thread across multiple emblems, while the vertical mode asks the reader to linger on a single emblem in order to explore connections up and down and among its parts. This essay will explore these two approaches to reading Atalanta fugiens, arguing that their juxtaposition transforms Atalanta fugiens into a flexible instrument for generating new knowledge about chymistry. It is significant, however, that both modes of reading require the reader to activate multiple senses—not only the intellect, but also the eye and ear. This, I argue, makes Atalanta fugiens into a commentary on the place of reading and writing—and their relationship to other bodily ways of knowing—in the production of chymical knowledge. Atalanta fugiens cultivated particular habits of mind and body, making a serious point that chymical truths were divine truths, and that the chymist must deploy the intellect and the senses to uncover chymical secrets. In showing his readers how to read Atalanta fugiens, in other words, Maier taught them how to practice chymistry, and ultimately to feed both the intellect and the soul with new truths about nature’s chymical arcana. Horizontal Reading Vertical Reading List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography How to Read Atalanta fugiens Maier was in fact quite explicit about how he thought aspiring chymists should read his book. His title page and Author’s Epigram point towards the most straightforward horizontal way to approach the book, which is to follow the story of the race, the consummation of Atalanta and Hippomenes’ love, and, finally, their ultimate transformation into lions. The book first sets out this theme in the images on the title page. We see the Garden of the Hesperides (guarded by a many-headed dragon, Ladon), Venus, Cybele’s temple, Atalanta and Hippomenes (both during their race and after their transformation into lions), all of which outline the tale to follow. Turning the page, however, the reader finds not images but words: Maier’s verse epigram, which expands the visual cues on the title page to alert the reader to his basic chymical interpretation. Atalanta represents philosophical mercury and Hippomenes philosophical sulfur, Maier explains, the two elemental qualities of matter that the alchemist must combine in order to produce the philosophers’ stone. By linking Atalanta and Hippomenes’ union and transformation into lions to the alchemist’s production of the philosophers’ stone, Maier suggests that a skillful chymical interpretation of the lovers’ tale might reveal how to make this most precious of alchemical desiderata. Proceeding to the emblems themselves, the reader finally comes to the third element of the book: the music. It, too, initially seems to reinforce Maier’s suggestion that the emblems will divulge alchemical secrets via the tale of Atalanta and Hippomenes. As the reader turns the page to Emblem I, scanning left to right, her eye first falls upon the music and the marginal labels for the three voices: “Atalanta, or voice fleeing,” “Hippomenes, or voice following,” and “the apple thrown, or voice delaying.” By now, these characters would be familiar, and by placing his melodies in their mouths, Maier seems to suggest that the interplay of the three voices, together with image and text, will drive Atalanta fugiens forward and fulfill the promise of Maier’s title page to unfold the alchemical meaning of the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes. Atalanta fugiens immediately complicates this proposal, however, for it turns out that the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes does not, in fact, carry through the emblems. It is tempting to imagine, for example, that the order of voices in the canons would mirror Ovid’s plot, so that Atalanta’s voice would begin the canon when she is in the lead, the Apple’s part would begin when Hippomenes tosses the apples in front of Atalanta, and, eventually, Hippomenes would begin the canons as he surges ahead to take the lead. This is not the structure of the canons, however. Rather, the Apple is nearly always the lead voice, followed by Atalanta, then Hippomenes, foiling any neat correlation between the order of the voices and the shifting lead in the race. Nor do Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the Apple sing about their contest and its fallout; rather, their lyrics, which come from the related epigrams, are about chymical epistemology, processes, and materials. Finally, while the images in the emblems are full of classicized figures and landscapes, Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the goddesses who shape their narrative never appear in the images after the title page. In short, the conceit of Atalanta fugiens and Maier’s initial frame for his chymical treatise fall away almost immediately, leaving the reader without the promised narrative thread to follow through the fifty emblems. Maier’s bait and switch is productive, however, causing the reader to stumble for a moment, to pause and consider how to proceed without Atalanta as the promised guide. Fortunately, the experienced reader could recover her footing quickly by drawing on familiarity with the two genres that informed the structure of Atalanta fugiens: emblems and illustrated alchemical texts. The emblem book was the most obvious model for reading Atalanta fugiens given that Maier refers to his book as “New Chymical Emblems relating to the secrets of nature.” The fashionable print genre of the emblem book emerged out of older traditions such as the Greek epigram, hieroglyphics, imprese, florilegia, medals, and heraldry and exploded in the wake of Andrea Alciato’s 1531 Emblematum liber (Book of Emblems) (fig. 2). Figure 2 In general, collections of emblems were meant to be read vertically, that is, one at a time and top to bottom, rather than sequentially, one emblem after the next. Typically, emblems used the motto-pictura-epigram format to convey truths about anything from love to politics and then to impress those insights upon the reader’s memory. The relationships among the three parts were often enigmatic, spurring the reader to reflection, creativity, and play, and making even a single emblem a perfect game in learned circles by providing fodder for erudite displays of virtuosity. Maier’s readers may also have been accustomed to thinking about alchemy, in particular, with both words and images, especially in the German-speaking lands, where the alchemical illustrated poem, or Bildgedicht, emerged. This late medieval tradition is epitomized by the Rosarium philosophorum (Rose Garden of the Philosophers), which wove together quotes from older alchemical texts with a series of twenty images (themselves “quotes” from earlier manuscript images), and which found its way into print as Part II of De alchimia opuscula complura veterum philosophorum [. . .] (Little Works on Alchemy from Many Ancient Philosophers, Frankfurt, 1550) (fig. 3). The sequence of images in the Rosarium philosophorum suggested a horizontal reading, as they followed the union, death and resurrection, and transformation of Sol and Luna into the philosophers’ stone. Atalanta fugiens was hardly sui generis, in other words, but rather rested on two well-established traditions: the humanist emblem and the illustrated alchemical text, both of which would have prepared readers for the kinds of vertical and horizontal reading that Maier’s emblems demanded. Figure 3 Readers of Atalanta fugiens who were new to chymistry and mostly familiar with emblem books (rather than alchemical Bildgedichte) likely would have approached any given emblem vertically. That is to say, they would have begun by reading the motto at the top, probably in Latin, but perhaps also (or instead) with a glance to the left to read it in German. Next, their eyes would have fallen on the image or pictura, which reinforced the message of the motto, and then, finally, on the epigram and discourses below, which expanded on the motto’s meaning. Emblem 11 offers a good example of how this works (fig. 4). The Latin motto, “Whiten Latona and tear your books,” is repeated in the pictura, where we see a woman seated in the center, being washed on the left by another classical figure. At her feet she has two children, one of whom has the head of a sun, and the other a moon on her head. On the right, a third classical figure is ripping up books. The pictura divides neatly into two halves, right under the ampersand of the motto, closely linking the bifurcated image to the motto above. Figure 4 Add to Collection The Latin epigram below the pictura gives more detail, but the learned reader would have immediately understood Maier’s classical reference. In Greek mythology, Latona is the mother of Apollo and Diana (gods of the sun and moon), represented as the twins at her feet. The beginning of the epigram confirms this: “Ancestors (of truth no doubt) to us relate / Latona’s twins produced from Jove the great.” A reader familiar with the alchemical corpus, moreover, would have recognized Maier’s clever word play as well. The motto, “Whiten Latona and tear your books,” cites a well-known alchemical injunction warning against confusing or misleading books: “Make Laton white and tear your books, that your hearts may not be destroyed.” Laton (or latten) is a yellow alloy of gold and silver that some alchemists believed must be purified further to produce the philosophers’ stone. Maier makes a slight adjustment, however, changing “Laton” into “Latona,” which gives him the opportunity to put a classicizing spin on chymical materials. “Some say She’s Sol with fair Diana mixed, / Having a face most white, some black betwixt,” he continues; in other words, Latona can produce sun and moon, or gold and silver, but she is impure, flecked with dark spots on her face. “Study my dear!” Maier concludes, “to wash these spots away, / Then burn those books which led your thoughts astray.” The text and image on the right side of Emblem 11, then, may be read as a proposal for action, an injunction to set books aside and manipulate matter in the laboratory (in this case, whitening and purifying an impure alloy as a step towards producing the philosophers’ stone and, ultimately, gold and silver). This kind of emblematic vertical reading guided readers down through the parts of any given emblem in Atalanta fugiens, leading them deeper into its chymical secrets. Maier’s inclusion of music, however, made even this type of vertical reading more complex. What if a European reader, accustomed to reading left to right, began with the German motto on the upper left, his eye then scrolling down through the music to the German epigram before moving across to the Latin version on the right that replaced the music with an image? What made Atalanta fugiens unique among emblem books and alchemical Bildgedichte, after all, was Maier’s inclusion of music, so it seems fitting that the fugue might have drawn a reader’s attention first, rather than the more familiar motto, image, and epigram on the right. Starting on the left, the reader would find the familiar canon format, with the Apple leading, then Atalanta, followed by Hippomenes. Their voices and melodies are framed above and below with German verse, but they sing in Latin, and this encourages the reader’s eye to wander down and to the right to the Latin epigram that provides the lyrics. Moreover, Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the Apple sing about chymistry, namely Laton(a) and the value of laboratory praxis over confusing books. If we remember that Maier’s readers would have encountered fifty emblems in Atalanta fugiens, then this repeated slippage in the music from Ovid’s tale into the laboratory becomes something of its own cantus firmus, a steady and recurrent reminder that Maier’s book is really about chymistry, despite its literary trappings. Let us imagine a different kind of reader, however: someone familiar with alchemical texts or Bildgedichte such as the Rosarium philosophorum, and thus expecting the emblems in Atalanta fugiens to outline a series of steps, perhaps for producing the philosophers’ stone. By Maier’s day, moreover, even the emblem book genre had begun to move in this direction, evolving from its original form as a collection of self-contained individual emblems into more coherent thematic collections. A reader well versed in alchemical texts, therefore, may have been inclined to dwell less on text and image in a single emblem, and to move horizontally instead, locating connections across multiple emblems. This possibility is in fact what made Atalanta fugiens especially promising. By framing his collection of emblems with the narrative of Atalanta and Hippomenes, telling his readers that the lovers’ tale should be understood as a method for making the philosophers’ stone, and then reminding them of this connection again and again at the outset of each of the fifty fugues, Maier suggested that there was a narrative linking his emblems after all. Certainly, Atalanta and Hippomenes disappeared after the opening pages, but perhaps the emblems told a tale of chymical processes instead, a step-by-step series of instructions for making the philosophers’ stone. Maier’s readers, in short, may have approached Atalanta fugiens with different kinds of expertise and expectations, and this would have produced different kinds of readings and lessons. If we envision that our reader has just finished reading and pondering Emblem 11, for example, where might he go from there? Perhaps he simply would have flipped the page to follow Atalanta and Hippomenes into Emblem 12, reading the emblems “in order.” He also might have decided to obey Maier’s exhortation to set aside confusing books entirely for the laboratory, putting down Atalanta fugiens and stoking a fire instead. On the other hand, this reader may well have chosen to remain within Atalanta fugiens, at least for the moment; that is, instead of proceeding from Emblem 11 to Emblem 12, he might have jumped from Emblem 11 into other parts of the book. Figure 5 Add to Collection He might have returned to the title page, for example, where the many-headed dragon Ladon sits in the Garden of the Hesperides guarding the golden apples, to ponder yet another dimension of Maier’s play on Laton/Latona (fig. 1). Or, this same reader might instead have flipped ahead in the book from Emblem 11 to Emblem 25, “The Dragon dies not, except he be killed by his brother and Sister, which are Sol and Luna” (fig. 5). In this emblem, we see Latona’s twins Sol and Luna again, now all grown up and attempting to bludgeon a dragon who, we are told, can only be killed by Sol and Luna. This dragon’s tail recalls Ladon’s on the title page, but Maier’s epigram tells us that the dragon here represents philosophical mercury, which can only be coagulated with Sol and Luna. Maier is again pointing to the laboratory, but one wonders: how is this step related to the one in Emblem 11 before, or, for that matter, to any of the others in between? Is there, perhaps, a chymical narrative threaded through the book after all, if one only knew how to find it? Compare Emblems Sol and Luna Collection Add to Emblem Collections My point here is not to answer these questions, to “figure out” the secrets that Maier embedded in his complex book. Clearly, there was no single way to read Atalanta fugiens, which drew on both the genre of the emblem book and the alchemical Bildgedicht (not to mention the feint that it was about Atalanta and Hippomenes) to shape readers’ expectations. In fact, the open-ended nature of Atalanta fugiens and the infinite number of links, layers, and hidden meanings embedded in it deliberately resist any possibility of “solving” the puzzle (although the fact that it is fun to try goes a long way towards explaining the book’s longevity). Rather, my point is that, despite its claim to be the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, the structure and content of Atalanta fugiens encourage its readers to read both vertically and horizontally, that is, not only to linger within a single emblem to consider internal connections among its visual, textual, and musical parts, but also to read across multiple emblems. Moreover, even this kind of horizontal reading offered numerous possibilities. One need not read sequentially (although one could) but could also skip around, flip back and forth, and construct groupings out of emblems otherwise dispersed throughout the book. Reading Atalanta fugiens this way, searching for connections and juxtapositions across and within emblems, is what turns the book into a tool, an instrument for multiplying meanings and endlessly generating new insights into nature, and possibly even producing valuable chymical materials in the laboratory. Non-Linear Reading Embodied Reading The multiple parts of Atalanta fugiens and the complicated relationships among them were not the only elements of Maier’s book that made reading difficult. Readers had to engage multiple parts of their own bodies and minds as well. After all, as Maier admonished, the book was to be “seen, read, meditated [upon], Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard. One needed eyes for the first two activities in this list, although Maier differentiated between seeing (pictures) and reading (words). He lists three different kinds of mental activity as well: meditating [upon], understanding, and distinguishing. These were different facets of intellectual work: taking in information, determining its meaning, and then weighing its significance with respect to other texts, images, or ideas. Finally, in order to grapple with Atalanta fugiens, one must use the mouth (or a musical instrument) to produce sound, and the ear to consume it. As Maier put it: That therefore we might have these three objects of the more spiritual senses, namely seeing and hearing, as also the understanding itself, as it were in one view and embrace, and insinuate all at once into mens minds for the better understanding thereof, behold we have joined the Optic together with Music, and sense with the understanding [sensum cum intellectu], that is, things rare to be seen and heard of with Chymical emblems, which are peculiar to this Science. Maier’s book deliberately engaged the intellect and the senses, in other words, and he challenged his readers to attempt to grasp chymical arcana with all of them at once. (The three lower perceptual faculties of touch, smell, and taste are notably and deliberately absent from Maier’s sensorium, although, as we know, plenty of people who examined and experimented with nature in early modern Europe used these senses as well.) So why choose emblems to convey chymical knowledge? In part, this reflected Maier’s deep investment in chymistry as a privileged and difficult endeavor. In invoking the “Chymical emblems, which are peculiar to this Science,” Maier endorsed a particular mode of communication as fitting for chymistry. Other “arts,” he noted, might communicate more directly, “they being willing and requisite to be understood by all men; Chemia not so, which as a chaste virgin ought to be seen through a veil, and as Diana, not without a garment of various colors.” Readers who were well read in alchemical literature would have nodded in agreement, given many (although by no means all) alchemical authors’ propensity towards allegory, poetry, and rhetorical techniques of “dispersion” (spreading dicta over a text) and Decknamen (code names for alchemical materials). For Maier, this was as it should be. Chymistry was not simply an artisanal practice, he explained, but was meant to challenge the intellect, and this is why he chose to present it in Atalanta fugiens as a collection of images, allegories, secrets, and musical rarities. The reader, listener, or viewer of Atalanta fugiens would not easily discover the secrets within—he or she must ponder them and perhaps discuss them with others—but the intellectual exercise would bring rewards in the end. Moreover, Maier confesses, representing chymistry as multimedia emblem might have an additional benefit. It made chymistry more appealing, more likely to catch and hold readers’ attention, and thus eventually to penetrate the intellect. One must approach the intellect gently, he explained, and with the proper protocol: “because the senses being inquisitors and messengers must first convey, and as warders the instruments of a city watching at the gates thereof inform and impart everything that is to be known, to the understanding, as the dictator and arbiter.” Then, if chymical knowledge “be first in bondage to the sense, there is no doubt but there will be a passage from the sense to the understanding as by a door.” The sensory pleasures of Atalanta fugiens, in other words, could draw readers in, and then open the intellect to the book’s deeper truths. As the Author’s Epigram to Atalanta fugiens concluded, “Your eyes with ease these Emblems may behold, / But reason must the mysteries unfold [At ratio arcanas expetat inde notas]: These things I’ve made familiar, that the mind / The treasures here enclosed may seek and find.” For all of these reasons, in Maier’s view, emblems were the perfect format for promoting and containing chymical knowledge. As a fashionable genre, emblems set the social context that Maier aspired to for chymistry, making it a learned and entertaining subject. Emblems also allowed for a suitably enigmatic presentation of chymical arcana, thus allowing Maier to print chymical secrets without divulging them to all. Furthermore, enhanced with sound and image, emblems could draw people to a subject that they otherwise might have avoided. The multiple advantages of emblems, therefore, addressed some of Maier’s concerns about chymistry’s public image, its social status, intellectual cachet, and presence in European print culture. I would like to suggest that the emblem format did something else as well, however. It focused Maier’s audience on an issue that was central not only to reading Atalanta fugiens, but also to the search for knowledge more generally: namely, how to strike the right balance between intellectual and sensory engagements with nature. In other words, learning to read about chymical arcana in emblems was also a way to calibrate the mind and body and, ultimately, to cultivate the skills required to practice chymistry. Chymical Practice In order to press his case about the proper balance between intellectual and sensory engagements with chymical arcana, Maier drew on late Renaissance understandings of philosophical psychology and cognition. Done properly, in his view, seeking “chymicall secrets” was one of the most dignified undertakings, second only to the pursuit of the divine. Drawing on a conventional Aristotelian hierarchy of the vegetative, sensitive, and intellective souls, Maier began the preface to Atalanta fugiens by explaining, “Candid Reader! It is a truth denied by none that man in his composition represents a compendium of the universe, and is destinated to live three kinds of life,” “vegetable,” “sensible,” and “intelligible.” In the “mothers womb,” he lives a “vegetable” life; “he grows and is increased like a plant.” In “this world,” he lives a “sensible” life, mostly guided by his senses, distinguished from animals only “in beginning to exercise the understanding, though imperfectly.” Finally, “in the other world with God,” he lives the “intelligible” life alongside the angels. Atalanta fugiens addressed the middle field, that is, the “sensible life,” where humans can make use of both the intellect and the “corporeal sense[s].” Using the intellect, he says, “more lofty wits, generously educated, and born to greater things” may approach the divine and pursue “things subtle wonderful and rare.” On the other hand, those “very many addicted to . . . the pleasures of the body, lust, gluttony, external pomp, and the like” limit themselves to the use of the senses, and thus to the “bestial kind.” Naturally, Maier envisioned himself and his readers to be among those “more lofty wits, generously educated, and born to greater things,” and he offered Atalanta fugiens as an instrument with which to pursue these aims. “Now to instruct and perfect the understanding,” he explained, “God has hidden infinite secrets in nature, which are forced out by innumerable arts and Sciences, as fire out of a flint, and transferred to use.” The interest in “secrets” was widespread among scholars and publishers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and Maier wanted to make it clear that chymistry, too, had secrets to offer. In his view, however, true chymical arcana were not mere recipes or techniques, the arcana peddled by what he called “circumforaneous impostors, and pseudochymical drones (who in these things are asini ad Lyram [asses to the lyre], because altogether strangers to all good learning and intention).” True chymical arcana, in Maier’s view, were not for sale, but were rather a divine gift to help humans develop their higher faculties. In fact, chymical arcana were the best secrets for this task. “Amongst these [gifts] Chymical secrets are not the meanest,” he proclaimed, “but next to the indagation of divine things, the principal and most precious of all.” In Maier’s hierarchy of cognitive engagements with the world, he clearly privileged the intellect. As Maier explained in his preface to Atalanta fugiens, true chymical secrets are “to be comprehended by the understanding [intellectu] sooner than by sense, rather by profound contemplation upon the reading of authors, and comparing them together, and with the works of nature, than sensitive operation, or manual experimentation, which is blind without previous theory.” Maier certainly does not call for a purely “intellectual” practice of alchemy, even as he does call for a methodical reading practice that includes “profound contemplation” of books. His claim, rather, is that the search for chymical secrets cannot succeed with the senses alone. Maier juxtaposed two different approaches to chymical knowledge. One method is to combine textual and laboratory practices, reading, reflecting upon, and comparing texts within the alchemical corpus and placing insights from books into conversation with “the works of nature.” For Maier, this careful reading and toggling between books and direct sensory engagement with nature was preferable to the other method, namely eschewing books in favor of “sensitive operation, or manual experimentation” alone, which he saw as “blind” because it lacked a theoretical framework. Maier expanded on this idea in the emblem we have already examined, Emblem 11, “Whiten Latona and tear your books” (fig. 4). There he acknowledged some of the limitations of approaching chymistry through books alone. By 1600 or so, the corpus of chymical texts was overwhelming and confusing. Not only was there a growing number of ancient, medieval, and now early modern texts, but reading them was difficult because of inconsistent terminology and sometimes riddling prose style. “So great is the diversity of Authors in writing, that the explorators of truth do almost despair of finding the end of art,” Maier noted in the discourse to Emblem 11. “[F]or Allegorical speeches being of themselves difficult to be understood, and the causes of many errors,” he continued, “especially then, if the same words be applied to different things, and different words to the same things.” All of this made it difficult to “perceive the truth involved in so great darkness, or of endless pains and charge in proving what is true, what not.” And so, Maier advised, quoting an injunction that appeared in other alchemical texts as well, “those books [must be] torn, lest their hearts be broken.” In other words, as the motto and epigram to Emblem 11 proclaim, the aspiring alchemist should tear his books, and dispense with misleading or confusing [ambiguous] books that only cause anguish. Maier’s advice in this emblem is a bit dramatic, to be sure (and certainly he did not intend for his readers to tear Atalanta fugiens apart!). His point is not that alchemical texts will always mislead and thus should be set aside entirely, but rather that they can be difficult, and, more importantly, that the laboratory can help the chymist navigate the library. “One is not sufficient without the other, an acute genius [ingenium acutum] without hand-labor,” he states directly, “as neither the theory without the practice, and contrarywise.” Figure 6 Add to Collection The key to chymical clarity is balance, following nature and gaining “experientia” on the one hand, and careful, deliberative reading [studio et lectio authorum] on the other. Each frame questions and clarifies the findings of the other, whether in books or in nature itself. And, as I have already suggested, the other elements of Emblem 11 underscore the importance of the laboratory by pointing the reader to practice. Maier returned to these themes again in Emblem 42, echoing and developing his argument that the true chymist must be guided by the interplay of theory and practice (fig. 6). Emblem 42 is one of Maier’s more repetitive emblems, with image, text, and music all reiterating the point first made in the motto: “Nature, Reason, Experience and reading must be the guide, staff, Spectacles, and Lamp to him that is employed in Chymical affairs.” The image reinforces the motto by depicting the chymist, a bearded man equipped with staff, spectacles, and a lamp, following in the footsteps of nature personified. As the accompanying discourse elaborates, the chymist is like a traveler. He needs: [i]n the first place, a companion or guide not ignorant of the ways, through which he must pass . . . Secondly, a Staff, by which the slipperiness and peril of the way, lest it be detrimental to a man, may be avoided: Thirdly, sound eyes, for such journeys are most dangerous to the blind or dim-sighted: Fourthly, a lamp or lighted torch, that the diversities and differences of the ways may be discerned . . . to wit, Nature, Reason, experience, and reading. Natura, in other words, provides not only the raw materials necessary for the chymist’s art, but also exemplars of how these materials behave. Ratio, the staff, prevents the chymist from stumbling, helping him sort out true from untrue; and Experientia, the spectacles, assist him in observing and thus building up a store of knowledge. Finally, Lectio, reading, is the lamp, “without which there will be every where darkness and thick clouds.” Maier not only underscores the importance of choosing good books, but takes the opportunity to address proper reading practices. One must read books repeatedly and patiently, he argues, for quick, superficial reading will only lead to failure and confusion. Likening these four elements of the chymist’s practice to a vehicle that allows the chymist to travel the path of Philosophical Medicine, Maier emphasizes that all must be present in order to make progress; “one of the wheels cannot be wanting, if it be left, it avails nothing.” The music in this emblem reinforces this message as well. Emblem 42 is one of the few emblems that departs from the standard order: Apple, then Atalanta, then Hippomenes. Rather, in this fugue, for the first time, two of the voices (Atalanta and the Apple) sing in unison, momentarily suspending the canon format of the book. [Audio 1: Fugue 42] Moreover, all three voices sing in even quarter notes, suggesting that they are now proceeding in lock step. Hippomenes, in other words, is apace with Atalanta and her apple, just as the chymist steps right in the footsteps of nature. ▶ Fuga 42 All three voices sing in unison. Your browser does not support the audio element. Armed with both spectacles and a lamp, the chymist in Emblem 42 draws particular attention to the sense of sight. Historians are not accustomed to thinking of alchemists as individuals with particular visual expertise. We associate the trained eye much more closely with the naturalist combing the landscape for specimens of plants, for example, or with the physician, whose ability to differentiate among numerous shades of yellow was central to the practice of uroscopy. Yet alchemists, too, relied heavily on sight in their practice, scrutinizing color changes, the rise and fall of vapors, and the qualities and location of solid matter in their retorts as purveyors of crucial information about the progress of the transformations they hoped to effect, as well as signs of how and when to intervene in those processes. Figure 7 Some of the iconography around alchemy acknowledged the importance of visual acuity for practitioners, in both a positive and negative way. As seen in David Teniers the Younger’s seventeenth-century painting, alembics, retorts, and flasks appear prominently in early modern representations of the alchemist in his laboratory, where he often is depicted peering into these glass vessels—or, more pointedly, decidedly ignoring that glassware, as if neglecting to carefully monitor the contents within, or simply not seeing what was important about them, is itself a sign of faulty practice (fig. 7). Even in the more straightforward satires of the alchemist as the “pseudo-chymical drone” whom Maier despised, vision plays a prominent role in highlighting failure and folly. Von der Artzney bayder Glück, for example, the 1532 German edition of Petrarch’s De remediis utriusque fortunae (Remedies for Fortunes Fair and Foul), concludes a denunciation of the folly of alchemy by noting that, “[i]n the end many [alchemists] lose first intellectual vision [augen des gemuts] and then the use of their physical eyes [ubung die leyplichen augen] to boot.” The accompanying image to this passage shows the alchemist in spectacles, his failing eyes an external, bodily manifestation of failing intellect, destroyed by the foolish pursuit of alchemy (fig. 8). Figure 8 Maier attempts to flip this critique on its head, however. In Emblem 42, he places spectacles on his chymist not to represent weak, failing eyes, but rather the power of “art” to bolster the chymist’s insights into nature. “Experience will be as Spectacles, by which things may be seen at a distance,” Maier explains; “[t]hese are optic instruments, invented and made by art, to help and amend the weakness of mens eyes.” Just as spectacles or telescopes extend the limited sense of sight, he proposes, so too must chymists turn to “art”—“experiments [experimenta] about the mineral matter of every kind”—to build up their “experiences” of nature (in the conventional Aristotelian sense of a store of memories that allow one eventually to build up understanding), “which the more they are in memory, the more will a man of reason draw from thence, and compare them among and with other things, that he may perceive, what is true, what not.” In short, Maier’s spectacles represent the chymist’s laboratory practice, the “experiments about the mineral matter of every kind” that allow him to build up an understanding of nature and thus to better grasp the chymical arcana concealed in nature. The chymical eye that Atalanta fugiens invokes, in other words, is not simply the sense of sight, but rather intellectual insight. The book equips readers with spectacles of their own, as it were, by pointing practitioners to the laboratory to carry out their own experimenta. But what about the music? Did Maier hope to cultivate a chymical ear, as well as a chymical eye? Maier was less explicit about how singing and hearing the music in Atalanta fugiens might translate into chymical practice, but he did address music generally in his Preface to the Reader, underscoring the importance of music, “both vocal and instrumental,” in antiquity. Greek philosophers, he noted, regarded as ignorant anyone “who refused the Harp in festivals,” highlighting the sociability of music performance, and perhaps hinting at how his own fugues should be sung in social settings. Maier also pointed out how essential music was to education for Socrates, Plato (who, Maier commented, “concluded him not harmoniously compounded, that delighted not in Musical harmony”), and, of course, Pythagoras, “who is said to have used the symphony of music morning, and evening to compose the minds of his disciples.” Music, then, could promote sociability and exemplify harmony, but it could also set the appropriate mood for study. It was the power of music to influence the hearer’s disposition [affectus] that especially interested Maier, and that offers a clue to how he might have imagined the sense of hearing to be related to the practice of chymistry. “[T]his is a peculiar virtue of Music,” he wrote, “to quicken or refresh the affections by the different musical measures.” The Phrygian mode, for example, akin to the modern minor scale, was “warlike, because it was sung in war, and upon engagement, and had a singular virtue in stirring up the Spirits of the Soldiers,” whereas the Ionian mode, or the modern major scale, had the opposite effect, producing amity and calm. Maier’s implication here was that, just as music could set the appropriate mood for students, warriors, and diplomats to carry out their work, so too could it prepare the chymist’s body and mind to explore nature’s secrets. In making this claim, Maier drew on a long tradition, from Orpheus to the Renaissance magus Cornelius Agrippa, that positioned music as an important part of prayer, healing, natural magic, and the dispelling of evil spirits. This particular use of music was rare in an alchemical context, although it was quite prominent in the work of the Paracelsian physician and author Heinrich Khunrath, who invitingly placed a pile of musical instruments smack in the middle of one of the most elaborate images associated with alchemy, his Lab-Oratorium, which appeared in his Amphitheatrum sapientae aeternae (Amphitheater of Eternal Wisdom, 1595/1609), shortly before Atalanta fugiens. Peter Forshaw has explored at length the role of music in this image, arguing that Khunrath’s instruments allude to numerical concepts of weight, number, and proportion (in this case, of chymical materials), as well as to the harmonious balance between theory and practice, heaven and earth, and spirit and matter. Khunrath was also interested in the musical modes in the context of sacred music and theurgic ritual, however, a subject that the “oratory” half of his image explores. Maier borrowed liberally from Khunrath in his writings, so Atalanta fugiens may well have been responding in some way to Khunrath’s complex imagery. Just as significant, however, is the fact that Maier’s melodies are not, as they may appear, Maier’s original compositions, but are, rather, quotes of existing liturgical melodies. For the Apple’s cantus firmus that is present in all fifty fugues, Maier used a liturgical melody, the Kyrie Cunctipotens genitor Deus (All-Powerful Creator), a Gregorian chant setting for the Mass ordinary. Helen Joy Sleeper first identified this as the Apple part in 1938, describing the Cunctipotens genitor deus as “one of the most familiar of church melodies, and one, moreover, employed by composers from an anonymous eleventh- or twelfth-century writer to Frescobaldi in the seventeenth century.” But Maier had a more specific source for using the Kyrie in this way, overlaid with a two-voice canon. As Loren Ludwig argues, Maier took forty of the fifty fugues in Atalanta fugiens from a collection of short, three-part vocal pieces, or “waies,” published by the English composer John Farmer in 1591. If the canonic interaction of the three voices purports to tells the story of the contest between Atalanta and Hippomenes, therefore, the actual melodies they sing point to liturgical music and suggest a Christian, rather than classical, context for Maier’s book. On one level, Maier’s choice of melodies underscored the notion of chymical arcana as a way to approach the divine. But if music was important to Maier because it prepared the chymist’s affectus, then we must also understand his fugues not as a narrative technique, or part of his elaborate game in Atalanta fugiens, but also as part of the deliberate, careful training of senses and intellect, body and mind, that he viewed as necessary to practice chymistry properly. Conclusion I have suggested that the multimedia emblems in Maier’s original edition of Atalanta fugiens were, among other things, an epistemological tool, and a meditation on the relationship between the intellect and the senses of sight and hearing in the practice of chymistry. In focusing his readers on this issue by using the format of the musical emblem book, Maier asked them to prepare their minds and their bodies to grapple with chymistry. Whether reading books or carrying out laboratory practices, Maier’s chymist engaged his entire body, including the intellect. Only then could he hope to grasp the chymical arcana that God had placed in nature to develop his intellect and lift him above the beasts. Seventy years after Maier published Atalanta fugiens, however, it was possible to imagine chymistry without this entire corporal edifice. When Georg Heinrich Oehrling republished Maier’s masterpiece in 1687, he did so without the music at all, keeping only the images with their associated Latin mottos and epigrams, and even editing out the references to music from Maier’s preface (fig. 9). In eliminating the music, the 1687 edition jettisoned the most complicated and demanding element in Atalanta fugiens, namely the interplay of myth and chymistry, returning Maier’s book to a more conventional emblem format and reducing it to an illustrated collection of alchemical dicta. In silencing the music, the 1687 edition also stripped Maier’s chymistry of its sacred context; the chymist might still need his eyes and intellect, but he no longer needed sacred music to prepare his disposition to understand nature’s secrets properly. It is tempting to say that “chymistry” was on its way to becoming “chemistry,” increasingly focused on the material engagement with nature in the laboratory, rather than on an outmoded resonance between nature and the divine or the remote classical past. Perhaps. But in discarding Maier’s vision of a fully embodied chymical practice, the 1687 edition of Atalanta fugiens may also have unmoored chymistry (or at least the project of the philosophers’ stone) from the senses, turning it into a primarily intellectual and literary practice, and thus also paving the way for its abstraction in the nineteenth century and its absorption into “the occult.” Figure 9 List of Illustrations Figure 1 Frontispiece, Atalanta fugiens.

In the preface, optics and music are among the “innumerable arts and sciences” the reader needs to search out God’s hidden secrets. Explaining Emblem 1, “Wind carried him in his belly,” Maier presents three examples of the mysterious “him”: in arithmetic it is the cubed root; in music, the perfect fifth; and in astronomy it is the center of the planets Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter. Emblem 8 uses the common technique of a perspective tunnel to focus the image. As a whole, the book is held together by music, as Eric Bianchi shows. Any Renaissance reader would have found these allusions to perspective, astronomy, and music instantly recognizable as “applied” or mixed sciences, rooted in the theoretical knowledge of arithmetic and geometry. Figure 1 Add to Collection In Emblem 21 (fig. 1), mathematics moves into the foreground: “Make of the man and the woman a circle, of that a quadrangle, of this a triangle, of the same a circle, and you will have the Philosoph. Stone.” The emblem itself comes from the influential Rosarium philosophorum (Rose Garden of the Philosophers, 1550), in the chapter on conception by the alchemical King and Queen. In the Rosarium philosophorum, the emblem concludes a discussion of how substances mix, putrefy, and their seeds begin to grow and transform: “Aristotle” presents the squaring of the circle to sum up the process known as conception. The dichotomy of male and female is a familiar piece in the metaphorical repertory of early modern alchemy. Indeed, Emblem 21 here evokes themes that permeate Atalanta fugiens—the first two emblems play upon the male and female elements of the philosophers’ stone, its conception and generation, supplying the book with one of its governing metaphors. Nevertheless, Emblem 21 does not dwell on that rich dichotomy. Instead it spends most of its time on the ancient problem of squaring the circle. The epigram below the image underscores the explanatory power of mathematics, adding that “If this [matter of conception] too high and too abstruse you find, / Geometry will soon inform your mind.” Squaring the Circle Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. Why should squaring the circle help understand nature’s secrets, even the philosophers’ stone? This article takes up Maier’s injunction to consider how geometrical learning might support the alchemist, as part of Maier’s aim to present chymistry as serviceable to the state. By considering how Emblem 21 redeploys commonplaces about the famous mathematical problem, I wish to suggest the significance of mathematics as an archetypic form of innate knowledge, and how this could fuel a growing, fertile tension between learned and artisanal forms of knowledge. List of Illustrations Works Cited Citation Author Biography The Moth and the Child: Instinct and Experience Emblem 21 uses mathematics to make a point about the possibility of transformation in knowledge. The accompanying discourse makes clear that the emblem is not intended to give advice on the actual process of refining the philosophers’ stone, as some of the other emblems are, such as those on the philosophers’ bath (e.g. Emblem 28). This holds true even near the end of the discourse, where Maier gets most explicit about the emblem’s alchemical meaning. There he compares the transformation of a square into a circle to the conversion of inferior matter into the philosophers’ stone. Matter is a square, like the four elements, which metamorphoses through the three alchemical colors of earthy black, silvery white, and golden yellow, before ending up the final “invariable redness” [rubedo invariabilis] that characterizes the completed work. But what interests Maier is the metaphor of fertile conversion, as we see in an arithmetical metaphor for the same process: the resolution of the perfect number 6 into its divisors, ultimately into even and odd, until resolved into the unchanging divine One or Monad. The single sentence hints at the standard Pythagorean table of opposites, where even numbers are female, odd ones are male, and the One generates all numbers from within itself. As Maier forefronts the generation and transformation of these mathematical objects, the operational details fade. In the context of the alchemical work’s stage of conception, mathematics is a metaphor for fertility. This is not the fertility of nature’s secret workings. Instead, Maier uses mathematics to consider the human mind’s power and its sources. Mathematics helps Maier think through a fundamental problem for any defender of a new science: how is human knowledge generated and transformed? Are human minds simply vessels for ideas they were born with, or do they generate and nurture new knowledge? Maier begins with a classic place in Plato, whose Meno used mathematics to supply the paradigmatic argument for all knowledge actually being remembered: [W]hich to prove, [Plato] introduces a youth yet very young, ignorant, and illiterate, whom he instructed first in geometrical interrogations so that the youth was observed to answer directly to all questions, and nolens volens, or without consideration to have attained to the very marrow of so intricate a Science. Mathematics supplied the strongest basis for the claim that minds do not change—they simply remember. On this account, knowledge is a gift, “whether . . . first taught by heaven, or by the Gods of the heathen.” To explore this idea, Maier uses the metaphor of fire: sparks and glowing coals evoke the flash of inspiration. This was a real option for Renaissance thinkers, who might follow Marsilio Ficino in setting human intellectual power upon a Platonic footing, so that exceptional inventors of the arts and sciences might get their knowledge from ecstatic insight. But even though Maier accepts the image, he shifts the emphasis: It is one thing to say, that burning coals are covered under ashes in so great plenty, that if they may only appear by removing the ashes, they are sufficient to boil meat, or warm our cold limbs; it is another thing to affirm, that small sparks only do there lie hid, which, before they can be useful for boiling or warming, must by the industry, art, and care of man be stirred up, quickened, and nourished with fuel, otherwise they may easily be extinguished, and wholly reduced into cold ashes. Everyone has these “small sparks,” presumably given by God. But they must be cultivated. Nurture transforms such sparks into effective, useful knowledge. Such an emphasis on human “industry, art, and care” opens up space for knowledge as the product of labor. Maier sets up a dichotomy between those faculties that Renaissance thinkers widely distrusted for being unreliable (imagination and phantasy [imaginatio et phantasia]) and those that might supply certain knowledge (reason and experience [ratio et experientia]). Moreover, Maier links the former to Plato, and the latter to Aristotle. Imagination was known to concoct unreal links, being therefore an untrustworthy guide to reality; every practitioner of alchemy, in contrast, insisted that his craft was difficult and laborious, led by the twin guides of reason and experience. Figure 2 For someone like Maier, mathematics posed a peculiar challenge to reason and experience. Mathematics was associated with the opposite pole of remembered or inspired knowledge, not only because of Plato’s story of the untutored boy, but also because of the special powers of music and mathematics to move the soul. Heinrich Khunrath’s famous image of the learned alchemist nods to such associations (fig. 2). The adept kneels in his tabernacle, praying before a mise en abyme: an open book just like Khunrath’s own, opened to the page that visually correlates the divine and material world in the shape of a triangle, inscribed within a square, within a circle. Above, the top-most beam reminds our devout alchemist that “without divine inspiration, no man was ever great.” The tools of the musical arts lie on the central table, thrust towards the viewer: penknife, inkwell, notebook lined with musical staves, dividers, measuring scales, a harp, violin, and lute lie thrust towards the reader, with the most central text of the print advising on the special power of music: “With holy music, flee sadness and malignant spirits, for the Spirit of Yahweh freely sings in the heart drenched in pious joy.” Text on the top-most beam reminds our devout alchemist that “without divine inspiration, no man was ever great. The adept kneels in his tabernacle, praying before a mise en abyme: an open book just like Khunrath’s own, opened to the page that visually correlates the divine and material world in the shape of a triangle, inscribed within a square, within a circle The tools of the musical arts lie on the central table, thrust towards the viewer: penknife, inkwell, notebook lined with musical staves, dividers, measuring scales, a harp, violin, and lute lie thrust towards the reader, with the most central text of the print advising on the special power of music: “With holy music, flee sadness and malignant spirits, for the Spirit of Yahweh freely sings in the heart drenched in pious joy.” The image built on the biblical story of young David’s harp and song driving out the wicked spirits of a melancholic King Saul, and confirmed commonplace tales about Pythagoras curing the Dionysiac madness of a youth with music. Such tales were recounted in handbooks on the liberal arts that introduced students to the rudiments of mathematical music theory. This iconography also deepened the link between mathematics and a knowledge sourced in ecstatic imagination—after all, imagination manipulates images, shapes. It can be no accident that Khunrath places the table of tools a short distance away from the forge, which is supported by the two prominent pillars of ratio and experientia. Arithmetic and geometry were widely reputed to be certain, yet they appear to support an account of knowledge depending on inspiration, or at least imagination. In the discourse to Emblem 21, Maier solves this problematic association with inspiration by taking quadrature as a question of history. Squaring the circle is here an argument against Plato, and for Aristotle. Plato had said mathematical knowledge was remembered. Plato’s own student Aristotle, however, had reported that the solution to the quadrature of the circle was not yet known—even though it was in principle knowable. “Whereupon it might be demanded, why Plato wrote upon the door of his School, that he that was ignorant of Geometry Should not be admitted into it, he also having affirmed that children actually knew it?” In other words, if such knowledge is innate, surely Plato and his students would have known about the squaring of the circle. To buttress his argument against Plato, Maier turns to the animal world, comparing a moth and a child. Most animals have instinct, he points out, and from birth they naturally know to avoid dangers. But humans are different. “An infant knows not or shuns such things, except hurt, or his finger being a little burnt at the flame of a candle like a Fire-fly [pyrausta], which burns its wings and falls down.” Here Maier deploys a proverb from the ancient Greek collection of Zenobius, popularized by Erasmus in Adage 851, on “the moth’s demise” [pyraustae interitus], a saying that applies to those who seek their own destruction just as a moth flies to the flame. In emblem books of the sixteenth century, the proverbial moth was a well-known caution against dangerous innate tendencies—against the dangerous potential of one’s given character. Gabrieli Symeoni deployed the proverb in his own book of emblems: “just as the moth out of its nature [naturel], loving the brilliance of the fire in which it unwisely and knowingly is consumed, so he who too imprudently loves anything, gains only dishonor and misfortune.” The inborn nature—the ingenium—of the moth compels it to self-destruction. To emphasize the tragic nature of the moth, Maier compares it with other insects. “Why do not the young bee, the fly and gnat fly directly into fire, they not knowing by experience the danger from thence arising?” These other insects have self-preserving instincts, unlike the moth and unlike the helpless newborn human. The proverbial fact of the moth’s tragic ingenium allows Maier to say something about human knowledge, pushing back against the Platonist assumption that mathematics is innate. In fact, the quadrature of the circle is an example of knowledge that no one had in Plato’s time. “If Geometry be so natural and easy to children, how comes it to pass that the Square of a circle was not known to Plato himself, So that Aristotle the Scholar of Plato affirmed it possible to be known, but not as yet known?” The immediate implication is clear. The arts and sciences are not eternal verities, to be simply intuited or remembered. Even mathematics—the discipline most susceptible to that description—changes and develops with time. Therefore, space must be made for new forms of knowledge. Squaring the circle becomes an example of how unknown disciplines can legitimately be developed through ratio et experientia. The Failure of the Learned The transformation of knowledge does not happen overnight. Epigram 21 also alludes to the time it may take for a new discipline to emerge, when translated most literally: “If such a great matter does not quickly come to mind, if you take up the teaching of geometry, you will know all.” Patience is required. Maier confidently assumes his reader will agree that geometry—and specifically the geometry of circle squaring—will repay patience. To understand this confidence, we need to consider the status of quadrature of the circle in early modern mathematics. Like the moth and the flame, “squaring the circle” has become a modern proverb for quixotic attempts of human knowledge that are doomed to fail. We have known since the 1890s that a solution is formally impossible. Earlier in the nineteenth century, Augustus de Morgan already cast the circle-squarer as the archetype of thinkers lured to foolish, wasted study on unsolvable paradoxes, such as perpetual motion machines. Yet de Morgan satirized circle-squarers even while producing a ream of notes on the history of the problem—a history that revealed squaring the circle as a legitimate problem that had exercised the best mathematical minds since antiquity, along with problems such as duplicating the cube or trisecting an angle. The challenge was not to find a close approximation between a circle and a square, but rather to prove an exact equivalence, using only Euclidean principles, a compass, and a straightedge. In Maier’s time, squaring the circle was not a species of learned folly, but precisely the opposite: it was the archetype of knowledge that was possible but not yet possessed. Every university student knew this from Aristotle’s Categories, which had been used since antiquity to introduce students to the basics of logic. To argue that an object of knowledge exists even when no one knows of it (a tree falls in the forest even if nobody hears), Aristotle used quadrature as his evidence. “Take the squaring of the circle, for instance, if that can be called such as object. Although it exists as an object, the knowledge does not yet exist.” Aristotle set the quadrature as a central problem for Renaissance mathematicians. He also gave them examples of how his own contemporaries had failed. In his Physics, he sketched three attempts, one by Bryson, another by Antiphon, and the fullest by Hippocrates of Chios. In fact, Aristotle’s statements about quadrature were widely familiar to members of the republic of learning. When Nicholas of Cusa described his own attempt, he described it as a topic for learned conversation, in Aristotle’s language of knowability. Oronce Fine opened his attempt at a solution with a discussion of Aristotle’s statements on the topic; having given his subject an august history, from Aristotle and Archimedes to Cusanus, he demurred that he would hardly be worthy of his office if, as royal professor of mathematics, he left quadrature aside. A high-water mark was reached by Fine’s student Jean Borrel (Buteo), whose De quadratura circuli (On Squaring the Circle, 1559) based its critical reading of the problem on a step-by-step reconstruction of Bryson, Antiphon, and Hippocrates, out of Aristotle, before moving on to an analysis of the modern failures of Cusanus, Fine, and others. Borrel’s book served as a manual for would-be circle-squarers, as well as a cautionary tale. As a whole, the history of quadrature is one of failure, of ingenious solutions followed by ever sharper analysis and critique. Some of the more spectacular failures involved the tallest intellectual giants of the day. Maier and indeed the whole learned world heard about Julius Caesar Scaliger, who deigned to turn his princely expertise in philology to expurgate the errors of mere mathematicians. But his gorgeously printed Cyclometria (Measurement of the Circle) revealed his own fundamental errors of mathematical judgment, and mathematicians all over Europe darted at the great man’s exposed flank. Christoph Clavius penned the most widely read refutation, though rumors circulated also that formidable mathematicians such as Henry Savile found Scaliger’s quadrature nonsense. Over half a century later, Thomas Hobbes would play from the same script, convinced like Scaliger that his towering intellect would finally realize the possibility Aristotle had mentioned—only to be disabused of his mathematical prowess by the Oxford Savilian professor John Wallis. Yet spectacular failures did not eliminate hope that the circle might be squared. The very hubris of Scaliger and Hobbes in taking on quadrature indicates their high regard for the problem as the gold standard for the possibility of new knowledge. The Success of the Untutored Precisely because it was the reputable example of knowledge that was possible, but not yet possessed, the squaring of the circle could legitimate the kind of new knowledge Maier proposed. Recall the tenor of his argument: that “reason and experience” are the way forward in developing new knowledge; and that, contrary to what the Platonists might say, mathematics is evidence for the productivity of reason and experience. Near the end of the discourse, however, Maier’s argument moves from the lofty eminences of philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, to practical mathematics. Money and politics were certainly on Maier’s mind. After 1611, when Rudolf II died, he lost a powerful patron, and began traveling Europe and writing in search of a new one. After time in Rotterdam and London, he settled in Frankfurt am Main. In the two years leading up to the publication of Atalanta fugiens early in 1618, Maier had written several “chemical tracts” while he lay ill, including a De circulo physico quadrato (On the Natural [or: Physical] Circle Squared, 1616) dedicated to Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, a prince widely known for his alchemical interests. In April 1618—the ink on Atlanta fugiens barely dry—Maier sent it along with ten of his other books to the prince and was promptly appointed Medicus und Chymicus von Hauß aus [Court Physician and Chymist]. The books had achieved their main goal of catching the count’s eye. Maier himself later admitted these books were meant to gain attention—indeed to sell, as they were “inspired more by the small payment which I received for them rather than by the improvement and perfection of the works themselves.” The contents of De circulo physico quadrato in no way attempted to contribute to the mathematical scholarship on quadrature. It developed a reflection on the “circular” motions of the natural four elements, which tend ultimately to circular perfection, in the heavens, on earth, and also in human hearts. The book culminated in reflections on the prince as the heart of his people, the center who unified disparate members within the political ambit. Maier opened De circulo physico quadrato with a familiar hook in the first sentence of the dedication: Aristotle claimed that in his time, most illustrious prince, the quadrature of the circle was not known, though knowable. After him many—too quickly shouting that Archimidean phrase ‘eureka, eureka’—proclaim that they have discovered it, while others say something else. Most only deal only with geometrical subjects, while few deal with subjects that look not so much to mathematics as to physical matter, such as natural bodies. Thankfully, Maier was available to ensure that the prince would have the chemical, medical, and indeed moral knowledge he needed to care for his subjects. Squaring the circle—or at least the “physical circle”—was a matter of state utility. Throughout the discourse attached to Emblem 21 of Atalanta fugiens, Maier has been concerned with practical knowledge; the “sparks of inspiration” resolve in a cooking analogy, where the flame serves digestion and the cook’s tasks. Near the end of the discourse he assures the reader that he intends something much more useful than the mathematicians can give: “Now that this quadration is Physical and agreeable to nature, every man understands; by which far more utility accrues to a Commonwealth as also more illustration to the mind of man, than by that Mathematical and merely theoretical or from an abstracted matter.” Then Maier takes this argument one step further, tying successful quadrature to practical utility. Not only is squaring the circle possible, but it has in fact been done by those with practical wit. After promising all manner of utility to the commonweal, he says that “To learn that perfectly, a Geometrician acting about solid bodies must inquire what depth of Solid figures, for example, of Sphere and Cube can be known, and transferred to manual use or practice.” What follows is a garbled example of practical mathematics, using a rule of thumb to approximate the size of a cube of the same area as a given sphere. By the time Maier has moved on to say that chymical philosophers’ work does the same thing, the point has been made: in fact, people do cube spheres, which shows the power of practice. Just as mathematical quadrature has actually been found by artisans who measure columns, dig wells, and gauge barrels, so too actually letting alchemists get on with their practice will result in new, useful knowledge. Maier here makes a point every circle-squarer knew—and struggled mightily to avoid. Craftsmen had always used rules of thumb for the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius (π = approx. 22/7) to convert circles to squares. Some theorists, such as Campanus, Nicholas of Cusa, and Charles de Bovelles, tried to formalize these techniques. Theorists often ridiculed such practical efforts as formally fallacious. Nevertheless, they could hardly forget their existence. It was common knowledge that an approximation can get arbitrarily close to success; the challenge is to make it perfect, within the self-imposed framework of Euclidean demonstration. It is perfectly possible to square the circle in a way that “satisfies the senses,” as Jakob Christmann put it. Because such solutions, even though off-limits in theory, are rather well suited to experience, the problem taunts. Common intuition is precisely what makes the problem alluring. Pragmatic accounts of the untutored mind’s success seem to have inflated the value of quadrature among the likes of Maier. For Maier, with his rhetoric of utility, must be seen as part of a larger group of projectors who stoked the desires of funders with wish lists, accounts of desiderata in knowledge that promised outstanding utility to princes and governors. The genre’s founder, the Paduan law professor Guido Pancirolli, included the quadrature in his Nova reperta (Two Books of Things Lost and Newly Found)—he offered a solution using mechanicians’ rules of thumb. His student Heinrich Salmuth set Pancirolli’s solution within the long history of mathematical solutions, from Antiphon and Brysson to Cusanus and Borrel. But his last two authorities were particularly telling: Peter Ramus and Jakob Christmann. Both had reflected upon how artisans had been able to satisfy the senses “honestly” [ingenue]. Quadrature was prominent on the lists of seventeenth-century utopian thinkers, who hoped to regain for mankind the knowledge lost after the Fall into sin. Johann Valentin Andreae, the Lutheran theologian who like Maier contributed to the early swell of Rosicrucian tracts, wrote a Mythologiae Christianae (Christian Mythology) which surveyed a fabulous marketplace filled with desirable knowledge from the art of memory to the quintessence. Andreae’s survey of the marketplace began with the quadrature of the circle. Jakob Bornitz, a politician who was connected to Maier’s circles through the Rudolphine court, likewise included quadrature on his list of things to be rediscovered and investigated, next to perpetual fire and techniques for navigating against the wind and under water. Bornitz’s list was influential: it was excerpted by the well-connected Samuel Hartlib into his own Ephemerides, as well as by the pedagogical reformer Jan Amos Comenius. These projects used squaring the circle as an intellectual desideratum in ways similar to Maier. Bornitz himself cited Scaliger to support the worthiness of quadrature as a pursuit, but he also referenced two less-learned examples. The Leiden mathematical teacher Ludolph van Ceulen, teacher to Willebrord Snell, wrote a study of quadrature which refined the practical method for approximating quadrature to the limit of the senses. Bornitz also cited an even more telling work from his and Maier’s own circles: the painter Philipp Uffenbach, who wrote a work on quadrature that celebrated the use of instruments beyond the compass and straightedge to offer a “new, short, extremely useful, and effortless mechanical treatise and account.” Such works contravened theoretical rules, but vindicated Maier’s promises at two levels. They played on learned assumptions about possible knowledge; they also fostered a growing assumption that letting artisans get on with it would bring such knowledge about. Instinct, Reason, and Experience This was polemic, of course, defending the associations of chymia with grubby labor. Maier had used quadrature to show the balance required between innate talent and cunning industry. Certainly, witless labor was no answer. At the end of De circulo physico quadrato, in some Cantilena Acreontica (Anacreontic Songs), Maier excoriated rivals for being entirely without inspired talent or acquired skill. The Ancreontic genre offered a chance to play with the themes of inspiration, wine, and sensory pleasure. These “stumbling verses” [claudicanta camaena] deride those who only think of vital powers lying in “smelly filth, and the limbs of animals” and not “in the metals dug from the deep hollows of the earth”; such people are “led by ignorance and madness of the mind.” Ultimately, Maier associates such people with a certain naïveté: For the purest metals are enclosed in hard clay, lest anyone still fast asleep or with hands yet unhardened by labor should try to get them out: lest he should burst the gate from its hinges—that fat, common day-laborer, who has not even a little of the saltcellar, of wit, of craft, of learning—lest any scoundrel or thief enter the holy places. Despite his praise for practice, Maier intended to eliminate neither class nor talent. One needed at least a spark of inborn wit to go with industry. Maier offers us a way to reconsider the usual dichotomies we use to understand early modern knowledge. The usual dichotomy is drawn between Descartes and Bacon: between rationalism and experimentalism, between reason and experience. But Maier—and the network of mathematicians, alchemists, and projectors who made up his world—drew the dichotomy differently. He was eager to claim ratio et experientia together as a pleonasm for chymistry; their contrast was innate knowledge, inspiration. An option was to put mathematics on the innate side of the ledger, aligning reason, imagination, and memory with the certainty of mathematical proof. Instead, Maier pushed for a vision of the human mind that admitted the origins of knowledge somehow in sparks of divinity—but to be useful, productive, these must be developed by reason and experience. On his retelling, mathematics became evidence that instinct was not enough, but must be nurtured through reason and experience. Once we see this formulation in Maier, we can begin to see its significance elsewhere. Around the time that Maier was writing De circulo physico quadrato and Atalanta fugiens, René Descartes was beginning his own study of mathematical learning, but with very different effects. For a brief while, Descartes was intrigued by Rosicrucian themes. In 1619, during his time in Germany, he wrote his old teacher Isaac Beeckman, asking after the art of Lull. When he returned to Paris in 1623, he found himself under suspicion of being a member of the Rosicrucian brotherhood—a suspicion that reemerged later in the century. What he shared with Maier and others linked to the Rosicrucian circles was a conviction in the need to develop one’s inborn talent. A famous passage in Descartes’ early Regulae ad directionem ingenium (Rules for the Direction of the Mind) reflects on the origins of knowledge in terms akin to those Maier used in Emblem 21: I can readily believe that the great minds of the past were to some extent aware of it, guided even by nature alone. For the human mind has within it a sort of spark of the divine, in which the first seeds of useful ways of thinking are sown, seeds which, however neglected and stifled by studies which impede them, often bear fruit of their own accord. The goal of the Regulae would have been quite familiar to Maier: to provide the reason and experience needed to develop the inborn light, seeds, or mind [lumen, semina, ingenium]. But the two differed in their evaluation of whether mathematical reasoning might itself be reason and experience. Descartes took the old bedrock disciplines, geometry and arithmetic, and transformed their exercise into a method for all the arts—what he called a mathesis universalis. Maier instead kept mathematics fixed within the cycle of arts, as a rhetorical and historical metaphor of transformation—leaving reason and experience to work without mathematics at the furnace.

His life was dedicated to an ill-fated quest for the Philosophers’ Stone, a quintessential extract of gold thought to possess divine healing powers mediated by the sun. In both his printed works and his practice as a physician, Maier charted an uneasy course between the traditional Galenic “book learning” of his schooling and the empirical chemical medicine pioneered by Paracelsus. As Paracelsian practice involved recourse to supernatural forces, Maier was also obliged to negotiate theological tensions between the Lutheran faith of his upbringing and the inspirationist pursuit of divine revelation unmediated by the ecclesiastical hierarchies. The Paracelsian inspirationism of Maier’s time was epitomised by the Rosicrucian manifestos, and anyone publically defending their programme — as Maier did in his Silentium post clamores (1617) and Themis aurea (1618) — ran substantial risk of persecution amid the rising sectarian hostilities of the Counter-Reformation. Yet esoteric knowledge transmitted in manuscript and oral form possessed significant currency among certain sections of the nobility, and as Europe descended into economic collapse and the devastation of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), Maier’s resort to this “economy of secrets” became increasingly desperate.A map of Maier’s peregrinations graphically depicts an early modern alchemist’s quest for medicines, for the knowledge and raw materials required to manufacture them, and for the patrons willing to purchase them. Maier was born in 1568 near Kiel on the northern border of the Holy Roman Empire, the son of a gold embroiderer (Goldsticker) in the service of Heinrich Rantzau (1526–1598), Governor of Schleswig-Holstein. Rantzau seems to have been an early patron of Maier’s, as well as an inspiration for his interest in Egypt as the font of the prisca sapientia. From 1587 Maier studied physics, mathematics, logic and astronomy at the University of Rostock; yet this first attempt to transcend his artisanal background came to nought, as he returned home without a degree four years later. In 1592 he defended some purely Galenic theses for his Master of Arts at Frankfurt an der Oder. There followed a period of three years’ medical training, during which Maier conducted his first laboratory experiments; however, at this point he was “unwilling to squander money” on the “dark and profound” art of alchemy. In 1595 he undertook a journey to the University of Padua, one of the foremost medical schools in Europe, where he acquired the title of Poet Laureate. Before a year had passed, however, he had fled in disgrace after wounding a fellow student. Despite the best efforts of the Paduan authorities, Maier managed to gain his doctorate at the University of Basel shortly thereafter.In the years immediately following his peregrinatio academica, Maier roamed the Hanseatic ports as a travelling vendor of Galenic remedies. During this period he claims to have become a “close acquaintance” of the famed astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), whom he met in Rostock and Hamburg; he also met the alchemist and Christian Cabalist Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605) while in Danzig, but he came to regard the man as a fraud (Betrüger). In December of 1601 Maier was to be found prescribing dried frogs in vinegar at the White Horse Inn in Danzig, but his sights were set upon a more lucrative business. His interest in alchemy had been piqued by the healing of a chronically ill man with an English aurum potabile (“potable gold,” a liquid or powdered form of the Philosophers’ Stone), and in 1603 he struck out along the trading route linking Danzig with the gold and silver mines of Hungarian Carpathia. Returning to his hometown near Kiel with the minerals he had acquired, he completed his first alchemical experiment at Easter, 1604.The pinnacle of Maier’s career was reached with his appointment as personal physician (Leibarzt) to Rudolf II — the melancholy emperor who felt he had been “bewitched,” such was his fascination with alchemy and occult philosophy. Maier had moved to Prague, the seat of the imperial court, at some time in 1608. The unique culture of pansophic humanist learning fostered there inspired his Arcana arcanissima (1614), the first comprehensive statement of Maier’s innovative hermeneutic paradigm: mythoalchemy, or the interpretation of Greek and Egyptian myths as ancient ciphers for alchemical processes.Despite gaining the prestigious title of Imperial Count Palatine, for reasons unknown Maier left Rudolf’s service in 1610. He subsequently gravitated towards the court of Landgrave Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, Germany’s foremost patron of alchemy, where the opportunity arose to investigate the English alchemical remedy he had first encountered in Danzig. Travelling to London, Maier met the infamous Francis Anthony (1550–1623), who for many years had been engaged in an acrimonious dispute with the College of Physicians concerning his aurum potabile. Maier defended his “good friend” in print, co-authoring Anthony’s Apologia veritatis illucescentis, pro auro potabili (1616), and when he returned to the continent in 1616, he took with him 200 Königsthaler worth of Anthony’s medicine in the hope of selling it at the annual Frankfurt Fair. But like Anthony before him, he was refused a license by the authorities — in this case by the city physician (Stadtarzt) of Frankfurt am Main, who personally testified to Maier’s inability to cure his patients with the aurum potabile.The Frankfurt Fair also provided an opportunity for Maier to sell his books, the majority of which were printed by the Frankfurt publishers Lucas Jennis and Johann Theodor de Bry; but in this enterprise, too, he failed to turn a profit. Despite his earlier attempts to secure the patronage of Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, Maier only gained a modest extra-mural position at the Hessian court in mid-1618, and this was revoked before his death. By 1619 he was living with his wife and children in Magdeburg, where his fortunes steadily declined amid the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis accompanying the early years of the Thirty Years’ War. In his desperation to procure raw materials for his aurum potabile (“red extract of common gold,” i.e. colloidal gold) and luna potabile (in all probability colloidal silver), Maier turned to his own wife’s pawned jewellery, as well as to debased coinage withdrawn from circulation. In this twilight of his career Maier also began to compose astrological, geomantic and medical tracts for Gebhardt Johann von Alvensleben (1576–1631), a noble landholder in the vicinity of Magdeburg; the unfinished Strategemata medica triaria included Paracelsian “white magical” remedies operating via the power of the imagination (vis imaginativa). Maier’s journey to Torgau to meet Paul Nagel (†1624), a Paracelsian chiliast who moved in the circles of both Jacob Böhme and the early Rosicrucians, provides another indication of this turn toward theologically equivocal arts.The end of Maier’s star-crossed quest for patronage came in 1622. Having produced an aurum potabile “far excelling” Anthony’s in efficacy, he set out for his native Holstein to deliver a sample to Duke Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf (1597–1659). Along the route home he stayed at Rostock, where he dedicated his Cantilenae intellectuales de phoenice redivivo to Duke Friedrich on 25 August 1622. However, he died before reaching Holstein, apparently from a chronic illness. Shortly thereafter bittersweet news arrived in Magdeburg: the King of Sweden (Gustav II Adolf, the Lutheran “Lion of the North”) was offering Maier free housing, upkeep and a salary of 2000 Reichsthaler in exchange for his services. Thus it seems Maier had been tantalizingly close to securing the kind of lucrative sponsorship for which he had vainly striven in the course of his itinerant and ultimately tragic life.","type":"essay"},{"id":"/front-matter/getacquainted/alchemy","title":"Early Modern Alchemy","author":"Jennifer M. Ramplingby Jennifer M. Rampling","body":"Alchemy was a novitas, a novelty, when it arrived in Christian Europe in the twelfth century. Known to the Latin West primarily from translations of Arabic texts, this new art taught how extraordinary physical transformations might be wrought through natural processes, harnessed by human ingenuity — specifically, by crafting a transmuting agent: the philosophers’ stone. While new to latinate readers, “alchemia” already had a long and multilingual history. In Greco-Roman Egypt, chemeia encompassed a variety of techniques for coloring substances: from dyeing wool purple, to tinging base metals gold or silver. In the Byzantine Empire, alchemy increasingly came to be associated with the transmutation of metals. Alchemists in the medieval Islamic lands developed an array of practices that related to medicine as well as metallurgy, within a theoretical armature influenced by the precepts of Greek and Arabic philosophy. Yet without the ancient pedigree of other, more securely-established fields of knowledge, such as geometry, medicine, and astrology, alchemy’s intellectual status in Christian Europe was initially uncertain. In making the case for alchemy as scientia — learned knowledge — rather than as a manual craft, its adherents adopted a variety of strategies. One was to invent authoritative founding figures, from Hermes Trismegistus, the legendary Egyptian sage, to ancient philosophers like Democritus, or Biblical authorities like Solomon. Another was to account for alchemical change using accepted philosophical and medical doctrines. In the thirteenth century, for instance, scholars sought to explain transmutation in terms of Aristotelian natural philosophy. In the sixteenth century, writers influenced by Renaissance humanism seized upon classical myth as a source of authority and a tool for interpretation. The rise of mechanical philosophies of matter over the next century brought atomist and corpuscular explanations to the fore, which in turn drew on earlier, medieval theories about the composition of metals. Alchemists were concerned with more than transmutation: they also sought to heal sickness and prolong life. During the 1350s, John of Rupescissa argued that the “quintessence,” a substance made by repeatedly distilling wine, represented a perfect balance of elements, capable of expelling sickness from human bodies. This notion, accompanied by growing practical interest in distilled remedies, influenced the development of chemical medicine during the sixteenth century: particularly through the interventions of the Swiss medical reformer Paracelsus (Theophrastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541), who proposed alchemy as a fundamental science of nature, and one imbued with profound religious significance. Alchemy’s diversity was reflected in its practitioners, who ranged from artisans, housewives, and merchants, to physicians, clerics, and natural philosophers. At the top of the early modern social ladder, alchemy also attracted princes and prelates, whose interest in the economic and political potential of alchemy frequently resulted in the licensing or financing of alchemical projects. The failure of several such enterprises in courtly settings cemented popular perceptions of alchemy as an art of deception, and its practitioners as fools or frauds. The need to reassure readers, convince sceptics, and impress prospective patrons contributed to some of the distinctive strategies employed in alchemical writing. Philosophically-oriented treatises offer instruction on the theory and practice of the science, often by setting out the sequence of operations necessary to produce the stone. Yet this advice typically obfuscates more than it explains. Vital information, including the identity of key ingredients, might be omitted, abbreviated, or disguised using fanciful cover names. By importing language and concepts from other fields of enquiry, including medicine, natural philosophy, and theology, writers also invoked powerful analogical relationships with the natural and divine worlds. The generation of the philosophers’ stone might be framed in terms of human or animal reproduction, while the putrefaction and perfection of base matter mapped conveniently onto Christian narratives of death and resurrection (fig. 1). Such strategies helped to both explain and justify alchemical procedures, while also preserving alchemy’s identity as a tradition of secret, privileged knowledge. Readers thus learned to approach alchemical texts and images as puzzles to be solved. Many seemingly obscure descriptions can in fact be “decoded” as recognizable chemical procedures. For instance, in Emblem 24 Maier shows the body of a king (representing gold, the “king” of metals) devoured by a wolf (stibnite, or antimony ore). Molten stibnite dissolves gold to form a gold-antimony alloy, causing any impurities to separate out. The antimony can then be driven off by strong heating, while the purified gold remains behind — depicted here by the resurrected king, emerging unscathed from the fire (fig. 2). A more complex scheme unfolds in the design of the “Ripley Scroll” (fig. 3): an emblematic roll embellished with English verses which was repeatedly copied throughout the sixteenth century. Here, the combination of metallic ingredients is represented as the coitus of male and female figures, the Sun and Moon (gold and silver). United by the philosophical mercury, this couple generates a child, the “soul” of metals. Yet the design also evokes themes from scripture and medieval romance, allowing us to situate its alchemical content within the broader context of late fifteenth-century England. The power of these analogies was not lost on painters, poets, and playwrights, who in turn incorporated the language of alchemy into literary and artistic works. Whether as a philosophical tradition, a body of practices, an entrepreneurial strategy, or an analogy for the relationship between nature and human art, alchemy was a powerful cultural force in early modern Europe.","type":"essay"},{"id":"/front-matter/getacquainted/printing","title":"Atalanta fugiens in the Printing Office","author":"Stephen Taborby Stephen Tabor","body":"Michael Maier’s Atalanta fugiens is a small tour de force of bookmaking that combines the specialized media of intaglio (copperplate etching) and typeset music with the more conventional — though still demanding — setting of texts in two languages using roman, italic, and black-letter types of various sizes. It is one of scores of elaborate illustrated works printed by Hieronymus Galler, many of them for the publisher Johann Theodor de Bry. The following introduction to the technical aspects of Maier’s book may serve to increase our appreciation for the labor that went into it. Atalanta fugiens, like the vast majority of books of its time, was printed on paper made by hand, sheet by sheet. (The process, as practiced in a traditional English papermill which, alas, closed in 1987, can be seen in the embedded video.) The paper used by Galler measured approximately 40 by 32 cm, four times the size of the finished book. Instead of cutting the sheets to size and printing them individually, Galler arranged his type in groups of four pages on each side of the sheet. With the correct layout, the finished sheets could be folded once in either direction (making a “French fold”), and the eight pages would come out in order. This common format was called a quarto; other possibilities included the larger folio (two pages to a side, four to a sheet), the smaller octavo (eight to a side, sixteen to a sheet), and so on down. These structures — called quires, signatures, or gatherings — provided folds for the binder to sew through, making a more durable construction than that produced by stabbing through individual leaves near their edges. Each copy of Atalanta fugiens contains 27 quires. To help keep them in order, the printer would give each one a letter of the alphabet. These can be seen at the bottom of some of the right-hand pages (the “rectos”). For instance, page 53 of the Atalanta bears the signature-mark “G3,” meaning it is the third leaf in quire G (fig. 1). The text was typeset by hand, about one metal letter per second. (The example above contains some examples of two letters cast on one body — the “æ” ligature in “quæ,” for example, and the “is” in “solis.” These helped to create a more calligraphic effect.) The music was set in the same way, note by note, each with its own section of staves. Figure 2 shows the gaps and discontinuities between the notes, characteristic of typeset music. Typesetting music was a specialized skill, particularly prone to typos, and it is possible that Galler subcontracted this part of the work to someone else. Even so, mistakes remain in the finished book. Figure 3 shows a printing press very like the one that would have been used by Galler. Although the quire (the sheet) was the structural unit of the book, Galler could only machine one side of the sheet at a time. The group of pages on the press at any one time was called a forme, and for the pressman this was the basic production unit. In the case of Maier’s quarto publication it consisted of four pages, and as you will see if you make a quire by folding a sheet of paper once in each direction, these pages were not continuous. Thus, the printer had to have his wits about him when arranging his pages to print. During the printing of a forme, a proofreader was usually at work. If he found errors, the press could be stopped and the type corrected; this process could repeat. The sheets already printed were not thrown away — the paper was half the cost of the book — so each sheet of the edition might have several correction states. When the sheets were collated to produce finished copies of the whole book, there was no compelling reason for early states of all the sheets to end up in the same copies. For this reason it is meaningless to speak of early or late “copies” of a hand-printed book; there are only early or late states of the individual formes. Figure 4 shows the Atalanta forme from quire O containing pages 105, 108, 109, and 112, as it came off of Galler’s press. We can immediately see that something is wrong here: the illustrations are missing. That is because they were created by a different process requiring a second production run on a different kind of press. The process, called intaglio, started with a polished copper plate. The plate was coated with a thin, acid-resistant layer, then the artist’s design was transferred to it; alternatively, the platemaker could work freehand from his model. (For Atalanta fugiens the artist was Matthäus Merian, although the plate was probably worked by one of his craftsman associates.) The platemaker used a sharp point to cut the design through the acid resist to the bare metal, then immersed the plate in an acid bath. The acid etched the design into shallow grooves; the process could be repeated to darken certain areas, or the platemaker could engrave stronger lines directly into the plate. Finally, the plate was cleared of the resist and printing could begin. Figure 5 shows an etched copperplate by Rembrandt, executed sixteen years after the Atalanta. Letterpress text is printed by inking the raised letter surfaces and pressing them into the paper. Intaglio is different: the printer coats the entire plate with ink, then polishes off the flat surface, leaving ink only in the crevices. For each plate in Atalanta fugiens, this process alone took several minutes. The plates were then set onto the blank spaces of the letterpress sheets and run through a rolling press, a steamroller sort of apparatus that produced immense pressure along a moving line to push the paper into the grooves of the plate and pick up the ink. Using foot-pressure helped to turn the rollers, and the impression of the metal plate’s edge is usually visible just outside the image on the printed page (fig. 6). For Atalanta fugiens, the words and music were printed in Galler’s shop, and then the sheets were transferred to a rolling press for completion (fig. 7). The example shown here went through the rolling press with two copperplates whose placement on the sheet was slightly crooked. Every copy of this sheet would be just a bit different in this regard, and if the plate printer’s mind was wandering, the illustrations might come out upside-down or interchanged. Aligning and registering the hollow rectangular copperplate border on the title page outside the already-printed letterpress text must have been particularly ticklish. Copies of the book are known with and without the portrait of a resolute Michael Maier on page 11. We don’t know the reason it appears in some copies and not others; perhaps the finished plate arrived too late to be printed in the earliest ones sold. We wouldn’t necessarily expect it to occur on the sheets with the latest correction state of the text, but this is a matter for further investigation. Atalanta fugiens was cleverly designed so that the difficult parts — the music and the illustrations — fall on only one of the two formes of each sheet, as figure 7 shows. The backing formes contain the straightforward texts of the Discursi, which by comparison were child’s play to produce. From Galler’s viewpoint it must have seemed almost like working on two separate books of very different complexities. All told, every copy of Atalanta fugiens represents 81 runs through a press — 82 for copies with the portrait. Multiply that number times the unknown number of copies in the edition, perhaps on the order of one thousand, and factor in a few other publications that Galler was probably working on simultaneously, and you get a feeling for the complexity of an early modern printing operation.","type":"essay"}]
