        Michael Maier’s <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> proposes at least two ways of reading its contents. First and foremost, Maier’s title
        page offers up a story (<strong>fig. 1</strong>). The etchings tell the tale of Atalanta, Hippomenes, and a trio
        of apples, while the title itself, “Atalanta fleeing,” puts Atalanta in motion, thereby inviting the
        reader to follow her flight to the final pages of the book. Even as the title page (literally) frames Maier’s
        masterpiece with a straightforward visual narrative, however, it immediately suggests a very different mode of
        reading as well. “Accommodated partly to the eyes and understanding [intellectus], . . . partly to the
        ears and recreation of the mind,” Maier’s title continues, the “New Chymical Emblems relating to the secrets of
        nature” within were “to be seen, read, meditated [upon], Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Accommodata partim oculis & intellectui . . . partim auribus & recreationi . . . videnda, legenda, meditanda, intelligenda, dijudicanda, canenda & audienda.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [1]. This and all English translations from “Atalanta running,” Beinecke Library.'>1</a></sup>
        With this subtitle, then, Maier underscores the fact that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is also a collection of
        emblems, a genre that demands of its reader not flight and forward motion but pause, lingering, and stillness.
        Moreover, the emblematic mode of reading demands multiple senses: not just the intellect or eyes but also (in
        this case) the voice and ears. In his preface to the reader, Maier points to the potential rewards of reading
        in these complicated ways, expressing his wish that “the learned have these figures in good estimation which are
        so useful and serviceable both to the understanding and many of the senses, that great utility besides delight
        and recreation may be expected from them.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“quid ni literati has figuras, quae & intellectui & sensibus pluribus inserviunt ita, ut magna inde sperando sit utilitas praeter oblectationem, in precio habeant & magni censeant.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 10.'>2</a></sup>

        We might think of these two modes of reading as horizontal and vertical. The <strong>horizontal mode</strong>
        encourages the reader to turn the page, reading sequentially in search of a narrative thread across multiple
        emblems, while the <strong>vertical mode</strong> asks the reader to linger on a single emblem in order to
        explore connections up and down and among its parts. This essay will explore these two approaches to reading
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, arguing that their juxtaposition transforms the work into a flexible
        instrument for generating new knowledge about chymistry.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier preferred the terms <em>chymicus</em> and <em>ars chymica</em> (or, more negatively, <em>pseudo-chymicus</em>) to <em>alchemist</em> or <em>alchemie</em>. I will follow his usage here, but also note that his understanding of <em>chymia</em> included transmutational alchemy. On Maier’s usage, see de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 11. For more on the complicated issue of terminology, see Newman and Principe, “Alchemy vs. Chemistry,” 32–65.'>3</a></sup>
        It is significant, however, that both modes of reading require the reader to activate multiple senses &mdash; not only
        the intellect but also the eye and ear. This, I argue, makes <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into a commentary on the
        place of reading and writing &mdash; and their relationship to other bodily ways of knowing &mdash; in the production of
        chymical knowledge.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='This topic is of interest to modern historians as well. For example, Smith, <em>Body of the Artisan</em>; Lawrence and Shapin, <em>Science Incarnate.</em>'>4</a></sup>
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> cultivated particular habits of mind and body, making a serious point that chymical
        truths were divine truths and that the chymist must deploy the intellect and the senses to uncover chymical
        secrets. In showing his readers how to read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in other words, Maier taught them how to
        practice chymistry and ultimately how to feed both the intellect and the soul with new truths about nature’s
        chymical arcana.

        <h2>How to Read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em></h2>
        <p>
          Maier was in fact quite explicit about how he thought aspiring chymists should read his book. His title page
          and author’s epigram point toward the most straightforward horizontal way of approaching the book, which is to
          follow the story of the race, the consummation of Atalanta and Hippomenes’ love, and, finally, their ultimate
          transformation into lions.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em> 10.565–707.'>5</a></sup> The book first sets out this
          theme in the images on the title page. We see the Garden of the Hesperides (guarded by a many-headed dragon,
          Ladon), Venus, Cybele’s temple, and Atalanta and Hippomenes (both during their race and after their transformation
          into lions), all of which outline the tale to follow.

          Turning the page, however, the reader finds not images but words: Maier’s verse epigram, which expands the
          visual cues on the title page to alert the reader to his basic chymical interpretation. Atalanta represents
          philosophical mercury and Hippomenes's philosophical sulfur, Maier explains, the two elemental qualities of
          matter that the alchemist must combine in order to produce the philosophers’ stone. By linking Atalanta and
          Hippomenes’s union and transformation into lions to the alchemist’s production of the philosophers’ stone,
          Maier suggests that a skillful chymical interpretation of the lovers’ tale might reveal how to make this most
          precious of alchemical desiderata.

        <p>
          Proceeding to the emblems themselves, the reader finally comes to the third element of the book: the music.
          It, too, initially seems to reinforce Maier’s suggestion that the emblems will divulge alchemical secrets via
          the tale of Atalanta and Hippomenes. As the reader turns the page to Emblem 1, scanning left to right, her eye
          first falls upon the music and the marginal labels for the three voices: “Atalanta, or voice fleeing,”
          “Hippomenes, or voice following,” and “the apple thrown, or voice delaying.” By now, these characters would be
          familiar, and by placing his melodies in their mouths, Maier seems to suggest that the interplay of the three
          voices, together with image and text, will drive <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> forward and fulfill the promise of
          Maier’s title page to unfold the alchemical meaning of the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes.

      <p>
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> immediately complicates this proposal, however, for it turns out that the story of
        Atalanta and Hippomenes does not, in fact, carry through the emblems. It is tempting to imagine, for example,
        that the order of voices in the canons would mirror Ovid’s plot, so that Atalanta’s voice would begin the canon
        when she is in the lead, the Apple’s part would begin when Hippomenes tosses the apples in front of Atalanta,
        and, eventually, Hippomenes would begin the canons as he surges ahead to take the lead. This is not the
        structure of the canons, however. Rather, the Apple is nearly always the lead voice, followed by Atalanta, then
        Hippomenes, foiling any neat correlation between the order of the voices and the shifting lead in the race. Nor
        do Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the Apple sing about their contest and its fallout; rather, their lyrics, which
        come from the related epigrams, are about chymical epistemology, processes, and materials. Finally, while the
        images in the emblems are full of classicized figures and landscapes, Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the goddesses
        who shape their narrative never appear in the images after the title page. In short, the conceit of <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> and Maier’s initial frame for his chymical treatise fall away almost immediately, leaving the
        reader without the promised narrative thread to follow through the fifty emblems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s bait and switch is productive, however, causing the reader to stumble for a moment, to pause and
        consider how to proceed without Atalanta as the promised guide. Fortunately, the experienced reader could
        recover her footing quickly by drawing on familiarity with the two genres that informed the structure of
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: emblems and illustrated alchemical texts. The emblem book was the most obvious model
        for reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> given that Maier refers to his book as “New Chymical Emblems relating to
        the secrets of nature.” The fashionable print genre of the emblem book emerged out of older traditions such as
        the Greek epigram, hieroglyphics, <em>imprese</em>, florilegia, medals, and heraldry and exploded in the wake of
        Andrea Alciato’s 1531 <em>Emblematum liber</em> (Book of emblems) (<strong>fig. 2</strong>).

        In general, collections of emblems were meant to be read vertically, that is, one at a time and top to bottom,
        rather than sequentially, one emblem after the next. Typically, emblems used the motto-<em>pictura</em>-epigram
        format to convey truths about anything from love to politics and then to impress those insights upon the
        reader’s memory. The relationships among the three parts were often enigmatic, spurring the reader to
        reflection, creativity, and play and making even a single emblem a perfect game in learned circles by providing
        fodder for erudite displays of virtuosity.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Maier’s readers may also have been accustomed to thinking about alchemy, in particular, with both words and
        images, especially in the German-speaking lands where the alchemical illustrated poem, or <em>Bildgedicht</em>,
        emerged. This late medieval tradition is epitomized by the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em> (Rose garden of the
        philosophers), which wove together quotes from older alchemical texts with a series of twenty images (themselves
        “quotes” from earlier manuscript images), and which found its way into print as part 2 of <em>De alchimia
          opuscula complura veterum philosophorum</em> [. . .] (Little works on alchemy from many ancient philosophers;
        Frankfurt, 1550) (<strong>fig. 3</strong>). The sequence of images in the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>
        suggested a horizontal reading, as they followed the union, death and resurrection, and transformation of Sol
        and Luna into the philosophers’ stone. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> was hardly sui generis, in other
        words, but rather rested on two well-established traditions: the humanist emblem and the illustrated alchemical
        text, both of which would have prepared readers for the kinds of vertical and horizontal reading that Maier’s
        emblems demanded.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Readers of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> who were new to chymistry and mostly familiar with emblem books (rather
        than alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>) likely would have approached any given emblem vertically. That is to say,
        they would have begun by reading the motto at the top, probably in Latin but perhaps also (or instead) with a
        glance to the left to read it in German. Next, their eyes would have fallen on the image or <em>pictura</em>,
        which reinforced the message of the motto, and then, finally, on the epigram and discourses below, which
        expanded on the motto’s meaning. <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="11">Emblem 11</a></span>
        offers a good example of how this works (<strong>fig. 4</strong>). The Latin motto, “Whiten Latona and tear your
        books,” is repeated in the <em>pictura</em>, where we see a woman seated in the center, being washed on the left
        by another classical figure. At her feet she has two children, one of whom has the sun as his head and the other
        a moon on her head. On the right, a third classical figure is ripping up books. The <em>pictura</em> divides
        neatly into two halves, right under the ampersand of the motto, closely linking the bifurcated image to the
        motto above.

        The Latin epigram below the <em>pictura</em> gives more detail, but the learned reader would have immediately
        understood Maier’s classical reference. In Greek mythology, Latona is the mother of Apollo and Diana (gods of
        the sun and moon), represented as the twins at her feet. The beginning of the epigram confirms this: “Ancestors
        (of truth no doubt) to us relate / Latona’s twins produced from Jove the great.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Latonae sobolem non novit nemo gemellam, / (Ceufert fama vetus) quae jove nata fuit.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 53.'>8</a></sup>
        A reader familiar with the alchemical corpus, moreover, would have recognized Maier’s clever wordplay as well.
        The motto, “Whiten Latona and tear your books,” cites a well-known alchemical injunction warning against
        confusing or misleading books: “Make Laton white and tear your books, that your hearts may not be
        destroyed.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Dealbate Latonam & rumpite libros.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 53. De Jong identified two sources for this quote, both in the second volume of the prominent collection of alchemical texts <em>Artis auriferae</em>: “Dealbate Latonem et libros rumpite, ne corda corrumpantur,” Morienus, <em>De Transmutatione Metallorum</em>, in <em>Artis auriferae</em> 2, 43–44; and “Dealbate Latonem et libros rumpite, ne corda vestre corrumpantur,” <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, in <em>Artis auriferae</em> 2, 305. See de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 115.'>9</a></sup>
        Laton (or latten) is a yellow alloy of gold and silver that some alchemists believed must be purified further to
        produce the philosophers’ stone.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 115–19 for a full discussion of this reference.'>10</a></sup>
        Maier makes a slight adjustment, however, changing “Laton” into “Latona,” which gives him the opportunity to put
        a classicizing spin on chymical materials. “Some say She’s Sol with fair Diana mixed, / Having a face most
        white, some black betwixt,” he continues; in other words, Latona can produce sun and moon, or gold and silver,
        but she is impure, flecked with dark spots on her face.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Hanc alii tradunt cum luna lumina solis / Mixta, nigrae cui sint in facie maculae.” Although in this phrasing it is the mixture that is flecked with dark spots, the following sentence, as well as the German translation and discourse, makes it clear that the spots are on Latona’s face, not her children. The analogy, in other words, breaks down a bit. Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 53.'>11</a></sup>
        “Study my dear!” Maier concludes, “to wash these spots away, / Then burn those books which led your thoughts
        astray.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Latonam ergo pares albescere, damnáque dantes / Ambiguos, adsit nec mora, rumpe libros.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 53.'>12</a></sup>
        The text and image on the right side of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="11">Emblem
            11</a></span>, then, may be read as a proposal for action, an injunction to set books aside and manipulate
        matter in the laboratory (in this case, whitening and purifying an impure alloy as a step toward producing the
        philosophers’ stone and, ultimately, gold and silver).
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of emblematic vertical reading guided readers down through the parts of any given emblem in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, leading them deeper into its chymical secrets. Maier’s inclusion of music, however,
        made even this type of vertical reading more complex. What if a European reader, accustomed to reading left to
        right, began with the German motto on the upper left, his eye then scrolling down through the music to the
        German epigram before moving across to the Latin version on the right that replaced the music with an image?
        What made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> unique among emblem books and alchemical <em>Bildgedichte</em>, after all,
        was Maier’s inclusion of music, so it seems fitting that the fugue might have drawn a reader’s attention first,
        rather than the more familiar motto, image, and epigram on the right. Starting on the left, the reader would
        find the familiar canon format, with the Apple leading, then Atalanta, followed by Hippomenes. Their voices and
        melodies are framed above and below with German verse, but they sing in Latin, and this encourages the reader’s
        eye to wander down and to the right to the Latin epigram that provides the lyrics. Moreover, Atalanta,
        Hippomenes, and the Apple sing about chymistry, namely Laton(a) and the value of laboratory praxis over
        confusing books. If we remember that Maier’s readers would have encountered fifty emblems in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, then this repeated slippage in the music from Ovid’s tale into the laboratory becomes something
        of its own <em>cantus firmus</em>, a steady and recurrent reminder that Maier’s book is really about chymistry,
        despite its literary trappings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us imagine a different kind of reader, however: someone familiar with alchemical texts or
        <em>Bildgedichte</em> such as the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, and thus expecting the emblems in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to outline a series of steps, perhaps for producing the philosophers’ stone. By
        Maier’s day, moreover, even the emblem book genre had begun to move in this direction, evolving from its
        original form as a collection of self-contained individual emblems into more coherent thematic collections. A
        reader well versed in alchemical texts, therefore, may have been inclined to dwell less on text and image in a
        single emblem and to move horizontally instead, locating connections across multiple emblems. This possibility
        is in fact what made <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> especially promising. By framing his collection of emblems with
        the narrative of Atalanta and Hippomenes, telling his readers that the lovers’ tale should be understood as a
        method for making the philosophers’ stone, and then reminding them of this connection again and again at the
        outset of each of the fifty fugues, Maier suggested that there was a narrative linking his emblems after all.
        Certainly, Atalanta and Hippomenes disappeared after the opening pages, but perhaps the emblems told a tale of
        chymical processes instead, a step-by-step series of instructions for making the philosophers’ stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s readers, in short, may have approached <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> with different kinds of expertise and
        expectations, and this would have produced different kinds of readings and lessons. If we envision that our
        reader has just finished reading and pondering <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="11">Emblem
            11</a></span>, for example, where might he go from there? Perhaps he simply would have flipped the page to
        follow Atalanta and Hippomenes into <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="12">Emblem
            12</a></span>, reading the emblems “in order.” He also might have decided to obey Maier’s exhortation to set
        aside confusing books entirely for the laboratory, putting down <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and stoking a fire
        instead. On the other hand, this reader may well have chosen to remain within <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, at
        least for the moment; that is, instead of proceeding from Emblem 11 to Emblem
            12, he might have jumped from Emblem
            11 into other parts of the book.

        He might have returned to the title page, for example, where the many-headed dragon Ladon sits in the Garden of
        the Hesperides guarding the golden apples, to ponder yet another dimension of Maier’s play on Laton/Latona
        (<strong>fig. 1</strong>). Or, this same reader might instead have flipped ahead in the book from <span><a
            href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="11">Emblem 11</a></span> to <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="25">Emblem 25</a></span>, “The Dragon dies not, except he be killed by
        his brother and Sister, which are Sol and Luna” (<strong>fig. 5</strong>). In this emblem, we see Latona’s twins
        Sol and Luna again, now all grown up and attempting to bludgeon a dragon who, we are told, can only be killed by them. This dragon’s tail recalls Ladon’s on the title page, but Maier’s epigram tells us that the dragon
        here represents philosophical mercury, which can only be coagulated with Sol and Luna. Maier is again pointing
        to the laboratory, but one wonders: how is this step related to the one in Emblem 11 before, or, for that matter, to any of the others in between? Is
        there, perhaps, a chymical narrative threaded through the book after all, if one only knew how to find it?

        My point here is not to answer these questions, to “figure out” the secrets that Maier embedded in his complex
        book. Clearly, there was no single way to read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, which drew on both the genre of the
        emblem book and the alchemical <em>Bildgedicht</em> (not to mention the feint that it was about Atalanta and
        Hippomenes) to shape readers’ expectations. In fact, the open-ended nature of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and the
        infinite number of links, layers, and hidden meanings embedded in it deliberately resist any possibility of
        “solving” the puzzle (although the fact that it is fun to try goes a long way towards explaining the book’s
        longevity). Rather, my point is that, despite its claim to be the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, the
        structure and content of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> encourage its readers to read both vertically and
        horizontally &mdash; that is, not only to linger within a single emblem to consider internal connections among its
        visual, textual, and musical parts, but also to read across multiple emblems. Moreover, even this kind of
        horizontal reading offered numerous possibilities. One need not read sequentially (although one could) but could
        also skip around, flip back and forth, and construct groupings out of emblems otherwise dispersed throughout the
        book. Reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> this way, searching for connections and juxtapositions across and within
        emblems, is what turns the book into a tool, an instrument for multiplying meanings and endlessly generating new
        insights into nature, and possibly even producing valuable chymical materials in the laboratory.

        The multiple parts of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and the complicated relationships among them were not the only
        elements of Maier’s book that made reading difficult. Readers had to engage multiple parts of their own bodies
        and minds as well. After all, as Maier admonished, the book was to be “seen, read, meditated [upon], Understood,
        distinguished, Sung and Heard.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In fact, despite the fact that Maier followed convention in placing a “letter to the reader” at the front of his book, it makes more sense to think about “users,” a term that leaves open the question of which faculties someone might have deployed to engage with the book.'>13</a></sup>
        One needed eyes for the first two activities in this list, although Maier differentiated between seeing
        (pictures) and reading (words). He lists three different kinds of mental activity as well: meditating (upon),
        understanding, and distinguishing. These were different facets of intellectual work: taking in information,
        determining its meaning, and then weighing its significance with respect to other texts, images, or ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, in order to grapple with <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, one must use the mouth (or a musical instrument) to
        produce sound and the ear to consume it. As Maier put it:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          That therefore we might have these three objects of the more spiritual senses, namely seeing and hearing, as
          also the understanding itself, as it were in one view and embrace, and insinuate all at once into mens minds
          for the better understanding thereof, behold we have joined the Optic together with Music, and sense with the
          understanding [sensum cum intellectu], that is, things rare to be seen and heard of with Chymical emblems,
          which are peculiar to this Science.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Haec tria itaque sensuum magis spiritualium, nempe visus & auditus, nec non intellectus ipsius objecta, ut in uno quase conspectu & complexu haberemus, & magis intelligendum animis simul & semel insinuaremus, En conjunximus Opticam cum Musica & sensum cum intellectu, hoc est, rara visu & auditu cum chymicis emblematibus, quae huic scientiae sund propria.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 8.'>14</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s book deliberately engaged the intellect <em>and</em> the senses, in other words, and he challenged his
        readers to attempt to grasp chymical arcana with all of them at once. (The three lower perceptual faculties of
        touch, smell, and taste are notably and deliberately absent from Maier’s sensorium, although, as we know, plenty
        of people who examined and experimented with nature in early modern Europe used these senses as well.)<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Smith, <em>Body of the Artisan</em>.'>15</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        So why choose emblems to convey chymical knowledge? In part, this choice reflected Maier’s deep investment in chymistry
        as a privileged and difficult endeavor. In invoking the “Chymical emblems, which are peculiar to this Science,”
        Maier endorses a particular mode of communication as fitting for chymistry. Other “arts,” he notes, might
        communicate more directly, “they being willing and requisite to be understood by all men; Chemia not so, which
        as a chaste virgin ought to be seen through a veil, and as Diana, not without a garment of various
        colors.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“cùm intelligi omnibus velint & debeant; Chemia non item, quae ut casta virgo per transennam, & veluti Diana, non absq.; veste variati coloris visenda est, propter causas alibi expressas.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 8.'>16</a></sup>
        Readers who were well read in alchemical literature would have nodded in agreement, given many (although by no
        means all) alchemical authors’ propensity towards allegory, poetry, and rhetorical techniques of “dispersion”
        (spreading <em>dicta</em> over a text) and <em>Decknamen</em> (code names for alchemical materials).<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On “dispersion” as a rhetorical technique for concealment, see Newman, “Alchemical Symbolism,” 71. On <em>Decknamen</em> and alchemy, see Newman, “‘Decknamen’ or Pseudochemical Language?”'>17</a></sup>
        For Maier, this was as it should be. Chymistry was not simply an artisanal practice, he explains, but was meant
        to challenge the intellect, and this is why he chose to present it in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a collection
        of images, allegories, secrets, and musical rarities. The reader, listener, or viewer of <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> would not easily discover the secrets within &mdash; he or she must ponder them and perhaps discuss them
        with others &mdash; but the intellectual exercise would bring rewards in the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, Maier confesses, representing chymistry as multimedia emblem might have an additional benefit. It made
        chymistry more appealing, more likely to catch and hold readers’ attention and thus eventually to penetrate the
        intellect. One must approach the intellect gently, he explains, and with the proper protocol: “[T]he senses being inquisitors and messengers must first convey, and as warders the instruments of a city watching at
        the gates thereof inform and impart everything that is to be known, to the understanding, as the dictator and
        arbiter.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ignoti nulla cupido, quia oportet, ut intellectui, veluti dictatori & arbitro, sensus indagatores & nuncii, omne scibile primitus apportent & innotescere faciant, tanquam Excubitores ad (sua organa) vicitatis alicujus portas invigiantes.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 9.'>18</a></sup>
        Then, if chymical knowledge “be first in bondage to the sense, there is no doubt but there will be a passage
        from the sense to the understanding as by a door.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“quod si verò primum sensui mancipatus, nullum est dubium quin à sensu ad intellectum transitus fiet, tanquam per ostium.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 9.'>19</a></sup>
        The sensory pleasures of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in other words, could draw readers in and then open the
        intellect to the book’s deeper truths. As the author’s epigram concludes, “Your
        eyes with ease these Emblems may behold, / But reason must the mysteries unfold [At ratio arcanas expetat
          inde notas]: / These things I’ve made familiar, that the mind / The treasures here enclosed may seek and
        find.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Auribus ista tuis, oculísque Emblemata prostent, / At ratio arcanas expetat inde notas: / Sensibus haec objecta tuli, intellectus ut illis / Illicibus caperet, quae preciosa latent.” Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2].'>20</a></sup>
        For all of these reasons, in Maier’s view, emblems were the perfect format for promoting and containing chymical
        knowledge. As a fashionable genre, emblems set the social context that Maier aspired to for chymistry, making it
        a learned and entertaining subject. Emblems also allowed for a suitably enigmatic presentation of chymical
        arcana, thus allowing Maier to print chymical secrets without divulging them to all. Furthermore, enhanced with
        sound and image, emblems could draw people to a subject that they otherwise might have avoided. The multiple
        advantages of emblems, therefore, addressed some of Maier’s concerns about chymistry’s public image, social
        status, intellectual cachet, and presence in European print culture.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the contested status of alchemy or chymistry in this period, see Moran, <em>Andreas Libavius</em>; Nummedal, <em>Alchemy and Authority.</em>'>21</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to suggest that the emblem format did something else as well, however. It focused Maier’s audience
        on an issue that was central not only to reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> but also to the search for knowledge
        more generally: namely, how to strike the right balance between intellectual and sensory engagements with
        nature. In other words, learning to read about chymical arcana in emblems was also a way to calibrate the mind
        and body and, ultimately, to cultivate the skills required to practice chymistry.

      <p>
        In order to press his case about the proper balance between intellectual and sensory engagements with chymical
        arcana, Maier drew on late Renaissance understandings of philosophical psychology and cognition.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='For an overview, see Park, “Organic Soul,” 465–67.'>22</a></sup> Done
        properly, in his view, seeking “chymicall secrets” was one of the most dignified undertakings, second only to
        the pursuit of the divine. Drawing on a conventional Aristotelian hierarchy of the vegetative, sensitive, and
        intellective souls, Maier begins the preface to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> by explaining, “Candid Reader! It is a
        truth denied by none that man in his composition represents a compendium of the universe, and is destinated to
        live three kinds of life” &mdash; “vegetable,” “sensible,” and “intelligible.” In the “mothers womb,” he lives a
        “vegetable” life; “he grows and is increased like a plant.” In “this world,” he lives a “sensible” life, mostly
        guided by his senses, distinguished from animals only “in beginning to exercise the understanding, though
        imperfectly.” Finally, “in the other world with God,” he lives the “intelligible” life alongside the angels.
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> addressed the middle field, that is, the “sensible life,” where humans can make use of
        both the intellect and the “corporeal sense[s].” Using the intellect, he says, “more lofty wits, generously
        educated, and born to greater things” may approach the divine and pursue “things subtle wonderful and rare.” On
        the other hand, those “very many addicted to . . . the pleasures of the body, lust, gluttony, external pomp, and
        the like” limit themselves to the use of the senses, and thus to the “bestial kind.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ominem, lector candide, universi compendium sui compositione referre, in confesso est omnium, & ternus vite generibus vivendis destinatum esse, nempe vegetabili in utero materno, ubi saltem plantae instar crescit & augmentatur, sensibili, nimirum in hoc mundo, ubi maxima ex parte sensibus ducitur, ceu reliqua animalia, à quibus differ, quod intellectu incipiat uti, licet imperfect; ac denique intelligibili, in altero mundo apud Deum, eique assistentes intelligentias seu Angelos bonos; In present vita, quo quis magis ad divinam naturam acedit, eò magis rebus intellectu indagandis, subtilibus, miris & raris, gaudet & delectatur: Et econtrà, quòquis ad pecuinū genus magis declinat, eò minus his capitur, & sensui corporaliori astrictus est: Utrorumque videmus Exempla, quosdam illis, ut pote doctiores, artibus & scientiis politos esse deditos, quàmplurimos hisce, nempe voluptatibus corporus, libidini, gulae, pompae externae, & his similibus.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 6.'>23</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, Maier envisioned himself and his readers to be among those “more lofty wits, generously educated, and
        born to greater things,” and he offered <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as an instrument with which to pursue these
        aims. “Now to instruct and perfect the understanding,” he explains, “God has hidden infinite secrets in nature,
        which are forced out by innumerable arts and Sciences, as fire out of a flint, and transferred to use.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ad excolendum autem intellectum Deus infinita arcana abdidit in natura, quae scientiis & artibus innumeris, ut ignis ex silice extunduntur, & in usum transferuntur.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 6.'>24</a></sup>
        The interest in “secrets” was widespread among scholars and publishers in the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries, and Maier wanted to make it clear that chymistry, too, had secrets to offer.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Eamon, <em>Science and the Secrets</em>; Leong and Rankin, <em>Secrets and Knowledge.</em>'>25</a></sup>
        In his view, however, true chymical arcana were not mere recipes or techniques, the arcana peddled by what he
        called “circumforaneous impostors, and pseudochymical drones (who in these things are asini ad Lyram [asses to
        the lyre], because altogether strangers to all good learning and intention).”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“non circumforaneis deceptoribus & fucis pseudo-chymicis (Qui in his sunt asini ad lyram, quipped ab omni bona doctrina & intentione alienissimi).” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 7. “Asini ad Lyram” (asses to the lyre), or incompetent people, was a proverb that circulated widely in the Renaissance. See, for example, Erasmus, “An Ass to the Lyre,” <em>Adages</em> 1.4.35.'>26</a></sup>
        True chymical arcana, in Maier’s view, were not for sale, but were rather a divine gift to help humans develop
        their higher faculties. In fact, chymical arcana were the best secrets for this task. “Amongst these [gifts]
        Chymical secrets are not the meanest,” he proclaims, “but next to the indagation of divine things, the
        principal and most precious of all.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Inter haec sunt Chymica secreta non postrema, sed post divinorum indagationem, omnium prima & preciosissima.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 6–7.'>27</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In Maier’s hierarchy of cognitive engagements with the world, he clearly privileged the intellect. As Maier
        explained in his preface to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, true chymical secrets are “to be comprehended by the understanding
        [intellectu] sooner than by sense, rather by profound contemplation upon the reading of authors, and
        comparing them together, and with the works of nature, than sensitive operation, or manual experimentation,
        which is blind without previous theory.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ideoque intellectu comprehendenda priùs, quàm sensu, potiùs per contemplationem profundam ex lectione authorum, eorumque inter se & cum naturae operibus comparationem, quàm operationem sensitivam, seu manualem experimentationem, quae coeca est sine Theorica praevia.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 7.'>28</a></sup>
        Maier certainly does not call for a purely “intellectual” practice of alchemy, even as he does call for a
        methodical reading practice that includes “profound contemplation” of books. His claim, rather, is that the
        search for chymical secrets cannot succeed with the senses alone. Maier juxtaposed two different approaches to
        chymical knowledge. One method is to combine textual and laboratory practices, reading, reflecting upon, and
        comparing texts within the alchemical corpus and placing insights from books into conversation with “the works
        of nature.” For Maier, this careful reading and toggling between books and direct sensory engagement with nature
        was preferable to the other method, namely eschewing books in favor of “sensitive operation, or manual
        experimentation” alone, which he saw as “blind” because it lacked a theoretical framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier expanded on this idea in the emblem we have already examined, <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="11">Emblem 11</a></span>, “Whiten Latona and tear your books” (<strong>fig. 4</strong>).
        There he acknowledged some of the limitations of approaching chymistry through books alone. By 1600 or so, the
        corpus of chymical texts was overwhelming and confusing. Not only was there a growing number of ancient,
        medieval, and now early modern texts, but reading them was difficult because of inconsistent terminology and
        sometimes riddling prose style. “So great is the diversity of Authors in writing, that the explorators of truth
        do almost despair of finding the end of art,” Maier notes in the discourse to Emblem 11. “[F]or Allegorical speeches being of
        themselves difficult to be understood, and the causes of many errors,” he continues, “especially then, if the
        same words be applied to different things, and different words to the same things.” All of this made it
        difficult to “perceive the truth involved in so great darkness, or of endless pains and charge in proving what
        is true, what not.” And so, Maier advises, quoting an injunction that appeared in other alchemical texts as
        well, “those books [must be] torn, lest their hearts be broken.” In other words, as the motto and epigram to Emblem 11 proclaim, the aspiring alchemist
        should tear his books, and dispense with misleading or confusing (ambiguous) books that only cause
        anguish.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Tanta est authorum in scribendo diversitas, ut ferè inquisitores veritatis de artis fine inveniendo desperent. Cùm enim per se allegorici sermones sint captu difficules & multorum errorum causae, tum inprimis, si vocabula rebus diversis eadem & iisdem diversa applicentur. Ex quibus si quis se extricare velit, oportet eū aut divini esse ingenii, ut perspiciat sub tantis tenebris latentem veritatem, aut laboris & sumptus in exhausti, ut experiatur, quid verum, quid non sit.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 54.'>29</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s advice in this emblem is a bit dramatic, to be sure (and certainly he did not intend for his readers to
        tear <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> apart!). His point is not that alchemical texts will always mislead and thus
        should be set aside entirely but rather that they can be difficult and, more importantly, that the laboratory
        can help the chymist navigate the library. “One is not sufficient without the other, an acute genius
        [ingenium acutum] without hand-labor,” he states directly, “as neither the theory without the practice,
        and contrarywise.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“At philosophi unum absque alio non sufficere dicunt, ingenium acutum absq[ue]; manuum labore, at hunc absq[ue]; illo, ut nec theoriam absque praxi & vice versa.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 54.'>30</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to chymical clarity is balance, following nature and gaining “experientia” on the one hand, and careful,
        deliberative reading (<em>studio et lectio authorum</em>) on the other. Each frame questions and clarifies the
        findings of the other, whether in books or in nature itself. And, as I have already suggested, the other
        elements of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="11">Emblem 11</a></span> underscore the
        importance of the laboratory by pointing the reader to practice.

      <p>
        Maier returns to these themes again in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="42">Emblem
            42</a></span>, echoing and developing his argument that the true chymist must be guided by the interplay of
        theory and practice (<strong>fig. 6</strong>). Emblem
            42 is one of Maier’s more repetitive emblems, with image, text, and music all reiterating the
        point first made in the motto: “Nature, Reason, Experience and reading must be the guide, staff, Spectacles, and
        Lamp to him that is employed in Chymical affairs.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“In Chymicis versanti Natura, Ratio, Experientia & lectio, sind Dux, scipio, perspicilia & lampas.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 176–79.'>31</a></sup>
        The image reinforces the motto by depicting the chymist, a bearded man equipped with staff, spectacles, and lamp, following in the footsteps of nature personified. As the accompanying discourse elaborates, the chymist is
        like a traveler. He needs:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          [i]n the first place, a companion or guide not ignorant of the ways, through which he must
          pass . . . Secondly, a Staff, by which the slipperiness and peril of the way, lest it be detrimental to a man,
          may be avoided: Thirdly, sound eyes, for such journeys are most dangerous to the blind or dim-sighted:
          Fourthly, a lamp or lighted torch, that the diversities and differences of the ways may be discerned . . . to
          wit, Nature, Reason, experience, and reading.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Primò locorum, per quae eundum erit, non ignarus comes aut dux: Si enim ignarus ignarum duxerit, idem iis quod caecis contingit, ut si non in foveam, tamen in errors & ambages ambo praecipitentur: Secundò, bacillus vel scipio, quo viae lubricitas, ne cui damnosa sit, praecavetur: Tertiò, oculi sani; caecis enim aut lippis ejusmodi itinera sund periculosissima: Quatrò lampas sive sax incense; ut discrimina viatum dignosci possint . . .videlicet Naturam, Rationem, Experientiam & Lectionem.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178.'>32</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Natura, in other words, provides not only the raw materials necessary for the chymist’s art but also exemplars
        of how these materials behave. Ratio, the staff, prevents the chymist from stumbling, helping him sort out true
        from untrue; and Experientia, the spectacles, assists him in observing and thus building up a store of
        knowledge.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“sine qua erunt ubique tenebrae & densae nubes.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178.'>33</a></sup>
        Finally, Lectio, reading, is the lamp, “without which there will be every where darkness and thick clouds.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“cui ex rotis una deesse nequit, si supersit, nil prodest.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178.'>34</a></sup>
        Maier not only underscores the importance of choosing good books but takes the opportunity to address proper
        reading practices. One must read books repeatedly and patiently, he argues, for quick, superficial reading will
        only lead to failure and confusion. Likening these four elements of the chymist’s practice to a vehicle that
        allows the chymist to travel the path of philosophical medicine, Maier emphasizes that all must be present in
        order to make progress; “one of the wheels cannot be wanting, if it be left, it avails nothing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The music in this emblem reinforces this message as well. <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="42">Emblem 42</a></span> is one of the few emblems that departs from the standard order:
        Apple, then Atalanta, then Hippomenes. Rather, in this fugue, for the first time, two of the voices (Atalanta
        and the Apple) sing in unison, momentarily suspending the canon format of the book. Moreover, all three voices sing in even quarter notes, suggesting that they are now proceeding in lockstep.
        Hippomenes, in other words, is apace with Atalanta and her apple, just as the chymist steps right in the
        footsteps of nature.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>Armed with both spectacles and a lamp, the chymist in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="42">Emblem 42</a></span> draws particular attention to the sense of sight. Historians are
        not accustomed to thinking of alchemists as individuals with particular visual expertise. We associate the
        trained eye much more closely with the naturalist combing the landscape for specimens of plants, for example, or
        with the physician, whose ability to differentiate among numerous shades of yellow was central to the practice
        of uroscopy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Stolberg, <em>Uroscopy</em>.'>36</a></sup> Yet
        alchemists, too, relied heavily on sight in their practice, scrutinizing color changes, the rise and fall of
        vapors, and the qualities and location of solid matter in their retorts as purveyors of crucial information
        about the progress of the transformations they hoped to effect, as well as signs of how and when to intervene in
        those processes.
      </p>
      <figure class="figure">
        <img src="/images/im13.jpg" alt="David Teniers the Younger’s painting The Alchemist in His Laboratory depicts an alchemist billowing the flames of his stove; the floor of his workspace is littered with empty vessels." width="2024" height="1708">

          <span class="title">Figure 7</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Some of the iconography around alchemy acknowledged the importance of visual acuity for practitioners, in both a
        positive and a negative way. As seen in David Teniers the Younger’s seventeenth-century painting, alembics,
        retorts, and flasks appear prominently in early modern representations of the alchemist in his laboratory, where
        he often is depicted peering into these glass vessels &mdash; or, more pointedly, decidedly ignoring that glassware, as
        if neglecting to carefully monitor the contents within or simply not seeing what was important about them, is
        itself a sign of faulty practice (<strong>fig. 7</strong>). Even in the more straightforward satires of the
        alchemist as the “pseudo-chymical drone” whom Maier despised, vision plays a prominent role in highlighting
        failure and folly. <em>Von der Artzney bayder Glück</em>, for example, the 1532 German edition of Petrarch’s
        <em>De remediis utriusque fortunae</em> (<em>Remedies for Fortune Fair and Foul</em>), concludes a denunciation of the
        folly of alchemy by noting that “[i]n the end many [alchemists] lose first intellectual vision [augen des
          gemuts] and then the use of their physical eyes [ubung die leyplichen augen] to boot.”<sup><a

        Maier attempts to flip this critique on its head, however. In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="42">Emblem 42</a></span>, he places spectacles on his chymist to represent not weak, failing
        eyes but rather the power of “art” to bolster the chymist’s insights into nature. “Experience will be as
        Spectacles, by which things may be seen at a distance,” Maier explains; “[t]hese are optic instruments, invented
        and made by art, to help and amend the weakness of mens eyes.” Just as spectacles or telescopes extend the
        limited sense of sight, he proposes, so too must chymists turn to “art” &mdash; “experiments [experimenta]
        about the mineral matter of every kind” &mdash; to build up their “experiences” of nature (in the conventional
        Aristotelian sense of a store of memories that allow one eventually to build up understanding), “which the more
        they are in memory, the more will a man of reason draw from thence, and compare them among and with other
        things, that he may perceive, what is true, what not.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Tertiò Experientia dabit perspicilia, quibus remota videri possint; Haec sund instrumenta optica imbecillitatem oculorum humanorum juvantia & corrigentia, arte inventa & facta. His persimilia sunt Experimenta circa mineralem materiam cujusque generis tentata, visa vel verè audita; quae quò plura fuerint in memoria, eò plura ratiocination inde sumet & inter & cum aliis comparabit, ut animadvertat, quid sit verum, quid non.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178.'>38</a></sup>
        In short, Maier’s spectacles represent the chymist’s laboratory practice that allows him to better grasp the
        chymical arcana concealed in nature. The chymical eye that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> invokes, in other words, is
        not simply the sense of sight but rather intellectual insight. The book equips readers with spectacles of their
        own, as it were, by pointing practitioners to the laboratory to carry out their own <em>experimenta</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Several of the emblems, in fact, describe chymical processes that a knowledgeable reader could translate into practice and thus “see farther” into nature’s secrets. For example, Emblems 9, 11, and 24.'>39</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        But what about the music? Did Maier hope to cultivate a chymical ear as well as a chymical eye? Maier is less
        explicit about how singing and hearing the music in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> might translate into chymical
        practice, but he does address music generally in his preface to the reader, underscoring the importance of music,
        “both vocal and instrumental,” in antiquity. Greek philosophers, he notes, regarded as ignorant anyone “who
        refused the Harp in festivals,”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“In hac antiqui Philosophi adeò se exercuerunt, ut indoctus haberetur, & ad [myrtum] canere cogeretur, qui [lyram] recusasset in conviviis.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 7.'>40</a></sup>
        highlighting the sociability of music performance and perhaps hinting at how his own fugues should be sung in
        social settings. Maier also points out how essential music was to education for Socrates, Plato (who, Maier
        commented, “concluded him not harmoniously compounded, that delighted not in Musical harmony”), and, of course,
        Pythagoras, “who is said to have used the symphony of music morning, and evening to compose the minds of his
        disciples.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“In Musica <em>Socrates</em> institutus & ipse <em>Plato</em>, qui non harmonicè compositū eum statuit, qui harmonia Muscicali non gaudeat: In eȃdem <em>Pythagoras</em> percelebris fuit, qui manè & vesperi musicae symphonia ad componendos suorum discipulorum animos usus dicitur.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178. '>41</a></sup>
        Music, then, could promote sociability and exemplify harmony, but it could also set the appropriate mood for
        study. It was the power of music to influence the hearer’s disposition (<em>affectus</em>) that especially
        interested Maier and that offers a clue to how he might have imagined the sense of hearing to be related to the
        practice of chymistry. “[T]his is a peculiar virtue of Music,” he writes, “to quicken or refresh the affections
        by the different musical measures.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Est enim Musicae haec peculiaris vis, ut effectus excitet vel mulceat, pro diverso Muscicali modo.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178.'>42</a></sup>
        The Phrygian mode, for example, akin to the modern minor scale, is “warlike, because it was sung in war, and
        upon engagement, and had a singular virtue in stirring up the Spirits of the Soldiers,” whereas the Ionian mode,
        or the modern major scale, has the opposite effect, producing amity and calm. Maier’s implication here is that,
        just as music could set the appropriate mood for students, warriors, and diplomats to carry out their work, so
        too could it prepare the chymist’s body and mind to explore nature’s secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In making this claim, Maier draws on a long tradition, from Orpheus to the Renaissance magus Cornelius Agrippa,
        that positioned music as an important part of prayer, healing, natural magic, and the dispelling of evil
        spirits.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Tomlinson, <em>Music in Renaissance Magic</em>. Music was also considered to be part of mathematics and thus the exploration of nature in a different way. See Gouk, <em>Music, Science, and Natural Magic</em>. See also Walker, “Musical Humanism.”'>43</a></sup>
        This particular use of music was rare in an alchemical context, although it was quite prominent in the work of
        the Paracelsian physician and author Heinrich Khunrath, who invitingly placed a pile of musical instruments
        smack in the middle of one of the most elaborate images associated with alchemy, his <em>Lab-Oratorium</em>,
        which appeared in his <em>Amphitheatrum sapientae aeternae</em> (Amphitheater of eternal wisdom,
        1595/1609) shortly before the publication of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Peter Forshaw has explored at length the role of music in
        this image, arguing that Khunrath’s instruments allude to numerical concepts of weight, number, and proportion
        (in this case, of chymical materials), as well as to the harmonious balance between theory and practice, heaven
        and earth, and spirit and matter.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Forshaw, “Oratorium &mdash; Auditorium &mdash; Laboratorium.”'>44</a></sup>
        Khunrath was also interested in the musical modes in the context of sacred music and theurgic ritual, however, a
        subject that the “oratory” half of his image explores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier borrowed liberally from Khunrath in his writings, so <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> may well have been
        responding in some way to Khunrath’s complex imagery.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For example, Maier lifted many of the “tricks” he attributed to “pseudo-chymists” in his <em>Examen fucorum pseudo-chymicorum</em> from Khunrath’s 1597 “Treuhertzige Warnungs-Vermahnung,” in <em>Von hylealischen</em>. Nummedal, <em>Alchemy and Authority</em>, 171.'>45</a></sup>
        Just as significant, however, is the fact that Maier’s melodies are not, as they may appear, his own original
        compositions, but are, rather, quotes of existing liturgical melodies. For the Apple’s <em>cantus firmus</em>
        that is present in all fifty fugues, Maier used a liturgical melody, the Kyrie <em>Cunctipotens genitor
          Deus</em> (All-powerful Creator), a Gregorian chant setting for the Mass ordinary. Helen Joy Sleeper first
        identified this as the Apple part in 1938, describing the <em>Cunctipotens genitor deus</em> as “one of the most
        familiar of church melodies, and one, moreover, employed by composers from an anonymous eleventh- or
        twelfth-century writer to Frescobaldi in the seventeenth century.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sleeper, “Alchemical Fugues,” 413. Sleeper’s discovery long went unacknowledged, however. For its reception in the historiography on <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, see Raasveld, “Michael Maiers <em>Atalanta</em>,” 359n9.'>46</a></sup>
        But Maier had a more specific source for using the Kyrie in this way, overlaid with a two-voice canon. As <a
          href="/essays/ludwig" target="_blank">Loren Ludwig</a> argues, Maier took forty of the fifty fugues in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> from a collection of short, three-part vocal pieces, or “waies,” published by the
        English composer John Farmer in 1591.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Farmer, <em>Divers & Sundry Waies.</em>'>47</a></sup> If the canonic interaction of the
        three voices purports to tell the story of the contest between Atalanta and Hippomenes, therefore, the actual
        melodies they sing point to liturgical music and suggest a Christian rather than classical context for Maier’s
        book. On one level, Maier’s choice of melodies underscores the notion of chymical arcana as a way to approach
        the divine. But if music was important to Maier because it prepared the chymist’s <em>affectus</em>, then we
        must also understand his fugues not as a narrative technique or part of his elaborate game in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> but also as part of the deliberate, careful training of senses and intellect, body and mind,
        that he viewed as necessary to practice chymistry properly.

      <p>
        I have suggested that the multimedia emblems in Maier’s original edition of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> were,
        among other things, an epistemological tool and a meditation on the relationship between the intellect and the
        senses of sight and hearing in the practice of chymistry. In focusing his readers on this issue by using the
        format of the musical emblem book, Maier asked them to prepare their minds and their bodies to grapple with
        chymistry. Whether reading books or carrying out laboratory practices, Maier’s chymist engaged his entire body,
        including the intellect. Only then could he hope to grasp the chymical arcana that God had placed in nature to
        develop his intellect and lift him above the beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seventy years after Maier published <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, however, it was possible to imagine chymistry
        without this entire corporal edifice. When Georg Heinrich Oehrling republished Maier’s masterpiece in 1687, he
        did so without the music at all, keeping only the images with their associated Latin mottos and epigrams and
        even editing out the references to music from Maier’s preface (<strong>fig. 9</strong>).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Secretioris naturae</em>. The German disappeared too, but since this was repeated in the Latin, it is less significant.'>48</a></sup>
        In eliminating the music, the 1687 edition jettisoned the most complicated and demanding element in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, namely the interplay of myth and chymistry, returning Maier’s book to a more conventional emblem
        format and reducing it to an illustrated collection of alchemical dicta. In silencing the music, the 1687
        edition also stripped Maier’s chymistry of its sacred context; the chymist might still need his eyes and
        intellect, but he no longer needed sacred music to prepare his disposition to understand nature’s secrets
        properly. It is tempting to say that “chymistry” was on its way to becoming “chemistry,” increasingly focused on
        the material engagement with nature in the laboratory rather than on an outmoded resonance between nature and
        the divine or the remote classical past. Perhaps. But in discarding Maier’s vision of a fully embodied chymical
        practice, the 1687 edition of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> may also have unmoored chymistry (or at least the
        project of the philosophers’ stone) from the senses, turning it into a primarily intellectual and literary
        practice and thus also paving the way for its abstraction in the nineteenth century and its absorption into
        “the occult.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
