        From the moment the printer Hieronymus Galler lifted its pages from his press, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> has
        been an intriguing, demanding book. With its multiple typefaces, music, and etchings, it is a virtuoso specimen
        of <a href="#" target="_blank">early modern print technology</a> and a prime example of the beautiful engraved
        books produced by the renowned publisher Johann Theodor de Bry and illustrated by Matthäus Merian.

        The book unfolds as a series of fifty emblems, each containing multiple parts: a motto and epigram in German and
        Latin, a copperplate etching, a fugue for three voices, and a Latin discourse that expands on the emblem’s
        themes. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> presents an alchemical realm where deities, heroes, and mortals mingle within
        fantastic landscapes and elaborate interiors. Some of the emblems depict identifiable laboratory processes,
        encoding alchemical practice and the marvels of material transformations in allegorical images. The layout of
        the book itself is elegant in its symmetry. The musical scores on the left mirror the images on the right;
        together with the surrounding text and subsequent discourses, each emblem set makes a neat package of music,
        image, and text.

      <p>
        The content of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is no less masterful, invoking a kind of erudition that was prevalent
        enough among scholars in 1618 but is rare today. Maier’s title page gestures to an Ovidian legend—the tale of
        the fleet-footed huntress Atalanta, whom Hippomenes hopes to best in a race by dropping three distracting golden
        apples in her path.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em> 10.565-707.'>1</a></sup> In Maier’s hands, however, Ovid’s
        central characters become chymical materials, while their interactions and transformations turn the ancient myth
        into a multimedia alchemical allegory designed to engage the ear, eye, and intellect. Only a reader equipped
        with a deep knowledge of classical myth, alchemy, natural history, music, mathematics, steganography, and
        medicine (not to mention the ability to read musical notation, German, and Latin) would have been up to the
        challenge of grasping the full significance of Maier’s clever text in 1618. As intimidating and kaleidoscopic as
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> may seem, however, its proposition is simple: all of the book’s parts are meant to
        work together, combining synergistically to reveal—or even produce—new insights into nature’s secrets. A shrewd
        reader could hope to acquire <a href="#" target="_blank">alchemical techniques</a> for making powerful medicines
        or precious metals, and even knowledge about the origins and transformation of matter. In 1618, Maier offered
        his readers a puzzle, a game, a chance to test out their own virtuosity and to uncover nature’s secrets. In
        other words, Michael Maier invited his readers to engage with the text in ways that might today be considered
        playful—and they have been playing with <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> ever since.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the ludic culture of Europe during this period, see especially Findlen, “Between Carnival and Lent.”'>2</a></sup>

      </p>
      <p>
        While we recognize and celebrate the fact that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> has had an unusually long and rich
        afterlife as an intellectual, musical, and aesthetic object, the following essays approach Maier’s text first
        and foremost as a historical artifact whose playfulness must be understood in the intellectual, cultural,
        political, and religious context of early seventeenth-century Europe. Our exploration of <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> emerges out of an intentional multidisciplinary collaboration among scholars of early modern
        print, music, art, philosophy, mathematics, and alchemy. We explore how <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> both
        contributed to and was shaped by early modern debates about epistemology and the senses, cryptography, humor and
        ludic culture, print as an instrument for producing knowledge, as well as the status of alchemy in a period in
        which it was deeply contested.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For more on these themes, see Smith, <em>Body of the Artisan</em>; Nummedal, <em>Alchemy and Authority</em>; Principe, <em>Secrets of Alchemy</em>; Dackerman, <em>Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge</em>, Sherman, “History of Cryptography”; Schiltz and Blackburn, <em>Music and Riddle Culture</em>.'>3</a></sup>
        Our starting point is the assertion that if in 1618 Maier could reasonably expect a single reader to have the
        wide-ranging erudition and skill-set to engage his book, then unpacking the riches of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        today requires multidisciplinary collaboration. For example, some modern scholars may read Latin but not German
        (or vice versa), while others may understand the visual conventions Maier draws on in his emblem landscapes but
        be entirely unfamiliar with the Phrygian mode in early modern music. Anthropomorphized images of philosophical
        sulfur or mercury are old hat to historians of alchemy, while to others, they might look like bizarre flights of
        fancy. In short, the fracturing of expertise into disciplinary bodies of knowledge means that scholars today can
        only grapple fully with the many dimensions of Maier’s ambitious text through multidisciplinary collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        We view <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, therefore, as an invitation and a challenge to reassemble collectively the
        expertise that Maier’s book demands. This approach departs from previous scholarship on <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> in several ways. First, this collection of essays is framed as a multidisciplinary conversation.
        Existing scholarly studies of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> have tended to highlight a single element of the
        book.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='De Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens.”</em>'>4</a></sup> For example, the major
        English-language study, H. M. E. de Jong’s 1969 <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens”: Sources of an Alchemical
          Book of Emblems</em>, focuses primarily on the intertextuality of the book. De Jong’s crucial insight was to
        identify the corpus of alchemical, medical, mythological, and natural historical works from which Maier drew
        both explicitly and implicitly, and her study makes clear the extent to which <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is a
        masterful work of textual synthesis. Maier’s authorship, she shows, lies primarily in his ability to weave
        together well-known alchemical aphorisms and to juxtapose them with new frameworks (not least the Ovidian tale
        of Atalanta and Hippomenes). De Jong’s attention to the literary elements of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, however,
        leaves open their relationship to the book’s images and music. Meanwhile, other scholars have maintained a tight
        focus on the music, select images, or Maier’s philosophical commitments.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Godwin, <em>Atalanta</em>, 10. The book originally came with a voucher for a cassette with the music, recorded by Emily Van Evera, Rufus Muller, and Richard Wistreich. This recording is now available digitally as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/maier-atalanta-fugiens/id293458777" target="_blank"><em>Maier: Atalanta Fugiens</em></a>. See also Raasveld, “Michael Maiers <em>Atalanta</em>”; Meinel, “Alchemie und Musik”; Sleeper, “Alchemical Fugues”; Hasler, “Performative and Multimedia Aspects”; Szőnyi, “Occult Semiotics and Iconology: Michael Maier’s Alchemical Emblems”; Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>; Wels, “Poetischer Hermetismus.” '>5</a></sup>
        All of these studies have advanced our understanding of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> in important ways, and
        certainly deep disciplinary expertise is crucial for situating Maier’s project in specific philosophical,
        artistic, literary, or musical contexts; however, approaching <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> from the perspective of
        one or two disciplinary perspectives at a time also has its limits. Maier’s intention, after all, was to
        <em>integrate</em> sight, sound, and intellect, and so we, too, must grapple with the connections, synergies,
        and also tensions he laid out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier studies of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> have also relied on an understanding of early modern alchemy that
        has been significantly challenged in recent decades. Once seen either negatively, as “superstition” or
        “pseudoscience,” or, more positively, as a primarily literary or philosophical project closely linked with
        Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and other “occult” philosophies, early modern alchemy is now also recognized as a
        fundamentally material endeavor, a set of practices deeply engaged with understanding and enacting the
        transformation of matter and closely associated with early modern science and medicine.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, esp., Martinón-Torres, “Historiography of Alchemy.” Moran et al, “Alchemy and the History of Science”; Garber, “Untwisting the Greene Lyon’s Tale.”'>6</a></sup>
        Informed by this new scholarly consensus in the history of alchemy, the following essays view <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> not only as a literary or philosophical text, cleverly adorned with music as well, but also as an
        invocation of actual laboratory technologies, potentially even a guide to the production of the philosophers’
        stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that Maier’s laboratory secrets are embedded in a such a virtuoso multimedia text, however, begs the
        question of its format—and makes clear the need for a multidisciplinary approach—even more urgently. If Maier
        wanted to communicate something about chymical processes, then why not simply publish a more straightforward
        book of recipes? There are many possible answers to this question, of course. Perhaps he wanted to hide his most
        profound secrets from the untutored, unworthy, or lazy, even as he divulged them for all to see in print. Maier
        also sought to elevate alchemy above its grubby artisanal roots, establishing it as a humanist, philosophical,
        emblematic, courtly art with the potential to access nature’s arcana. On this count <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        certainly succeeds, demonstrating that alchemy offered not just precious medicines or metals, but also fodder
        for mathematical games, musical riddles, artistic virtuosity, and classical erudition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s insistence on representing his chymical secrets musically, visually, <em>and</em> textually suggests
        that the multimedia format of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is a clue to Maier’s broader arguments. The first two
        essays in this collection, from Tara Nummedal and Michael Gaudio, argue for new ways of understanding how
        Maier’s audience may have read or looked at <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. <a href="/essays/nummedal"
          target="_blank">Nummedal</a> explores the experience and interpretation of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> through
        an examination of multiple modes of reading. She reveals the structural framework that underpins <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, showing how the design of this book adheres to both a horizontal and a vertical orientation. In
        one modality, the reader moves across Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book with the turn of each page; in the
        other, the individual emblem requires that the eye travel down the page, an action that invites lingering and
        contemplation of its textual and visual interplay in penetrating its hidden meaning. Maier’s musical alchemical
        emblem book is thus designed as both codex and scroll. At the same time, Nummedal argues that these reading
        practices also engage the reader’s body, making the act of reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into an exploration
        of the relationship between intellect and senses and, ultimately, of the proper practice of chymistry. In turn, the essay by 
        <a href="/essays/gaudio" target="_blank">Michael Gaudio</a> focuses on the captivating copper-plate
        etchings by the artist Matthäus Merian that have assured Atalanta fugiens’ renown across the centuries. Noting
        Merian’s unusual concentration on landscape depiction in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Gaudio situates this visual
        feature within a broader German landscape tradition. Moreover, he suggests, the “background” landscapes in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> are a commentary on the act of seeing, representing, and measuring nature. This visual
        mode of engaging nature, Gaudio argues, was an important first step for Maier, preceding the more emblematic act
        of “looking more deeply” at the foreground images. Just as Maier offers multiple ways of reading, according to
        Nummedal, so too does he encourage at least two different ways of seeing nature in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essays by Eric Bianchi and Peter J. Forshaw deepen our understanding of how Maier conceptualized <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> by examining the set of classical and contemporary sources that informed Maier’s use of music and
        mythology. <a href="/essays/bianchi" target="_blank">Eric Bianchi</a> provides us with access to the intellectual
        context and social milieu of Maier’s musical world in a reconstruction of his musical philosophy. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> evolved within a multifaceted
        cultural environment where it participated in lofty mathematical abstractions about cosmic harmony even as it
        reflected commonplace professional music practices. Maier’s approach to music was thus speculative <em>and</em>
        performative, and Bianchi’s study navigates between these seemingly opposed cultural forces. He discusses
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a work of music theory in terms of the relationship between the “sounded” music in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and the “silent” music of Maier’s later work, <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>
        (Intellectual Songs, 1622). As to the performative possibilities of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Bianchi explores
        how the visual is rendered audible through the musical technique of text painting, or “madrigalisms.” This vocal
        feature of the music also constitutes an important element of Maier’s sensorial delivery of chymical arcana,
        pointing to underlying relationships among Maier’s music, image, and text—how the images influenced the fugues,
        for example, or vice versa. Maier’s use of personifications in his musical scores merge Ovidian characters with
        alchemical philosophy, and the essay by <a href="/essays/forshaw" target="_blank">Peter J. Forshaw</a> presents a
        rich intertextual examination for understanding Maier’s use of myth in the context of alchemy. Forshaw
        elucidates a long tradition of alchemical interpretations of ancient myths, the literary genre known as
        mythoalchemy, which extends from the classical into the early modern period. This historiographical framework
        sheds new light on Maier’s adaptation of an Ovidian legend as the matrix for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Maier
        understood hieroglyphs and myths to be transmissions of ancient knowledge and wisdom from the Egyptians to the
        Greeks, presenting a coded language in which chymical secrets were embedded. Forshaw’s study places Maier’s use
        of emblems and the Atalanta story in relation to his earlier mythoalchemical work, Arcana arcanissima (Most
        Secret Secrets, 1614), which Forshaw argues is the core of a mytho-chymical project that plays out across
        several of Maier’s published works. <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is thus set within a wider alchemical program in
        which Maier uses myth and symbols to hide knowledge from the vulgar, yet at the same time to reveal knowledge to
        the learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final group of essays by Loren Ludwig, Richard Oosterhoff, and Donna Bilak explore Maier’s incorporation of
        music and mathematics into <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. <a href="/essays/ludwig" target="_blank">Loren Ludwig</a>
        argues that Maier did not, in fact, compose forty of the fifty “fugues” in this musical alchemical emblem book.
        Ludwig’s musicological analysis of Atalanta fugiens reveals how Maier repurposed a printed collection of choir
        exercises by the English composer John Farmer, <em>Diuers and sundry waies</em> (1591), thus connecting
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to earlier English musical and liturgical traditions. Ludwig’s finding recalibrates
        our understanding of how the “fugues” in Maier’s book support its alchemical program. This raises important
        questions about authorship and intentionality, as Maier’s adaptation of Farmer’s waies in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> reframes how we might interpret Maier’s curious integration of music in this book. The essay by <a
          href="/essays/oosterhoff" target="_blank">Richard Oosterhoff</a> explores Maier’s use of mathematics to
        support his alchemical agenda. Oosterhoff focuses on <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span>, which considers the ancient problem of squaring the circle,
        arguing that Maier dwells on this mathematical example as a sustained commentary on the creation and
        transformation of knowledge. According to Oosterhoff, Maier believed that if human knowledge could begin with
        the divine spark of inspiration, it must also be cultivated through the dedicated and sustained application of
        reason and experience, not through instinct, imagination, and phantasy. If squaring the circle was one of the
        most vexing mathematical problems, it was also, according to Oosterhof, an example par excellence of knowledge
        that was possible, even if not yet attained. In this sense, it became an important model for the possibility of
        metallic transmutation. At the same time, both <em>desiderata</em> also exposed the tensions, if not
        contradictions, between what might be possible in theory and in practice. The closing essay presents another
        viewpoint on Maier’s use of mathematics as a way to probe nature’s secrets. <a href="/essays/bilak"
          target="_blank">Donna Bilak</a> takes up the question of why Maier configured <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> around
        fifty fugue-emblem sets, arguing that Maier engineered his musical alchemical emblem book around a concealed
        mathematical puzzle. Discovery of this puzzle lies in finding and solving clues, “secret signs,” that Maier
        embedded in the emblems, and doing so effects a numerical transmutation that reshuffles their order.
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> becomes a game based on the reader’s ability to attain new insights about chymical
        arcana that the contemplation of new emblem groupings prompt, with the book itself serving as an object that
        hides Maier’s secret game in plain view. Bilak’s analysis of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a steganographic work
        invites a reading of Maier’s book in terms of cover text and ciphertext, opening up the study of alchemy to
        contemporary cryptographic practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collectively, these seven essays reposition <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a blend of theoretical, performative,
        and practical engagements with nature. Maier is not the artist, nor the musician, but he draws on sound and
        image, as well as mathematics and myth, to construct an alchemical allegory about the search for health and
        wealth. Moreover, by reordering, resequencing, or focusing on different elements of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        each time they opened the book, Maier’s readers could use it to generate almost endless new insights into
        nature’s secrets. The multiple parts of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, as well as the numerous potential ways of
        reading, seeing, and hearing it, put the book in motion, setting up a hunt for meaning and a dynamic reading
        practice that transformed it into a complex epistemological tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, these essays suggest that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is more than an exploration of the
        synergies, tensions, and intersections among the languages of musical score, copperplate etching, and Latin
        discourse. Maier may also have intended his book to address shifting anxieties around the early modern
        disciplines that bridged sense and intellect, theory and practice, scholarship and craft in the early
        seventeenth century. Music, art, and alchemy grappled with a similar set of tensions. These arts were all framed
        by theoretical literatures that could be quite abstract and scholarly; as a set of practices, however, they also
        required knowledge of technique and the material world. The very nature of these mixed arts, therefore, raised
        questions about whether they were a philosophy, a craft, or a mixture of the two, and how these elements related
        to one another. These complexities of education, training, praxis, and expertise mirrored social concerns about
        the position of the alchemist, the artist, and the musician between court, university, and workshop. Perhaps,
        these essays suggest, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> placed art, alchemy, music, and, more subtly, mathematics, in
        conversation because all of these arts grappled with a similar set of issues about the relationships among
        different forms of expertise, training, and practice in these mixed disciplines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essays that follow insist that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> must be understood in its original historical
        context, as an artifact of its author and his early seventeenth-century world. The meaning of <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, however, has always been in the hands of its readers, viewers, listeners, and singers. Indeed,
        it is impossible to ignore the fact that Maier’s contemporaries almost immediately seemed to want to amend,
        translate, and even disassemble <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, thereby reimagining its message for new generations.
        In fact, a constellation of <em>Atalanta</em>-objects began to appear around Maier’s original book already in
        the seventeenth century, highlighting the desire not simply to sit down and read the text, but rather to
        repurpose it for new contexts. Some individuals created their own customized copies, presumably for private use.

        Others replaced Maier’s Latin/German text with French or English translations, copying their new vernacular
        mottos, epigrams, and discourses—but not, notably, the fugues that originally accompanied them—into private
        miscellanies alongside other standard works from the centuries-old alchemical corpus (<strong>fig. 3</strong>).<sup><a href="#"

        One translator may have had a more public audience in mind for his English version, <em>Atalanta running, that
          is, new chymicall emblems relating to the secrets of nature</em>, which included the mottos, epigrams, and
        discourses, but not the images or the music (<strong>fig. 4</strong>). Now in the <a

        for the printing press, rather than a manuscript for private use, and we use it here as the English translation
        in our digital edition.

        Yet neither <em>Atalanta running</em> nor any of the other vernacular translations of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        made it into print in the seventeenth century; instead, they remained in private manuscript collections or
        perhaps exchanged among friends in the scholarly networks that extended across the early modern intellectual
        community known as the Republic of Letters.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Fumaroli, <em>The Republic of Letters</em>.'>9</a></sup> The fact that none of these
        manuscripts included the music suggests that they may date from the late seventeenth century, possibly modeled
        on a reconfigured printed version of Maier’s original that appeared in 1687 under a new title: <em>Secretioris
          naturae secretorum scrutinium chymicum</em> (The Chymical Investigation of the Most Secret Nature of Secrets).
        The publisher, Georg Heinrich Oehrling, dropped not only Maier’s original title and the vignettes detailing
        scenes from the Ovidian Atalanta story that framed it, but also one part of each emblem set: the page with the
        music and the German translations of the Latin mottos and epigrams.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Dropping the German mottos and epigrams was not an issue for long, however, for in 1708 Oehrling published a German translation of the entire 1687 edition, entitled <em>Chymisches Cabinet: derer grossen Geheimnussen der Natur</em>.'>10</a></sup>
        These changes radically transformed the book’s original program. In this 1687 edition, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        was no longer about sound and sight; the reader was no longer also a listener. The removal of the music ended up
        placing greater emphasis on the emblems and discourses. Like the anonymous authors of the French and English
        manuscript variants, Oehrling may have had any number of reasons to make these changes, not least of which was
        the cost of printing music or duplicative German. It had also been about seventy years since <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> first appeared, and the social, intellectual, and political context that had shaped Maier’s
        original book had changed too. Natural philosophy was increasingly institutionalized in scientific societies and
        journals, which played a crucial role in determining how (and how not) to write about nature. At the same time,
        the alchemical middle ground between art, science, literature, and music that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> occupied
        had also begun to pull apart. Parts of alchemy were increasingly being reframed as modern chemistry, while
        others were left behind, or moved out of scientific or medical discourse altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        These early manuscript and print adaptations suggest that it was often Maier’s text that held the most appeal
        for his earliest readers, who could sometimes do without the music and even the images. In at least one
        instance, however, it was the images that held the most appeal. The Bibliotheca Hermetica Philosophica in
        Amsterdam holds three seventeenth-century oak panels with oil paintings depicting figures from <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> mingling with figures from two other early modern alchemical texts, Basil Valentine’s
        <em>Practica cum duodecim clavibus</em> (Twelve Keys, 1677) and Johann Daniel Mylius’ <em>Philosophia
          reformata</em> (Philosophy Reformed, 1622).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Cis van Heertum and Jos&#233; Bauman, "Emblems in Print and Paint: <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and a curious case of seventeenth-century applied art," forthcoming.'>11</a></sup>
        These intriguing objects allowed the images in these three well-known alchemical texts to float free entirely of
        the words that once accompanied them, creating new visual schemes that referenced their original contexts only
        enigmatically and underscored alchemy’s potential as a purely symbolic language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Words without music; images without text. These seventeenth-century adaptations of Maier’s original point to a
        quality of the book that shaped the responses of even its first readers and which, we argue, has ensured that
        the book remains of interest today. Assembled out of discrete units of music, image, and text, <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> depends on its combination of media, its appeal to multiple senses, and its promise that only
        this particular assemblage can serve its aim: namely, to ponder the relationship between the senses and the
        intellect, and to reveal insights into nature both practical and philosophical. At the same time, the book also
        encourages its readers to take it apart, to reshuffle, select, and reimagine its elements. It was and is a book
        in parts, and this fundamental fact continues to inspire and interest users today. Modern readers continue to be
        drawn to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> for these reasons, as well as for the book’s beauty, arresting images, music,
        and enigmatic content. Contemporary artists have drawn on Maier’s imagery to reimagine the form of the book and
        its images today,<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Browsing for recordings of Maier’s music on Apple’s iTunes Store or on Bandcamp, one can find recordings in
        period style, as well as electronic and electroacoustic or metal versions. A search for #atalantafugiens on
        Instagram or Twitter reveals the book’s ongoing appeal to Rosicrucians, alchemists, and others who see it as an
        important repository of information about alchemical theories, imagery, and texts.<sup><a href="#"

        The unusual longevity of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is certainly noteworthy, raising pressing questions about why
        and how particular elements of early modern culture continue to resonate with twenty-first-century audiences,
        while others fade away. <a href="#" target="_blank">Our own digital edition</a> is, in a sense, part of the long
        afterlife of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and should be understood in this context. These accompanying essays are
        meant to anchor the edition historically, to frame users’ explorations of Maier’s extraordinary book as a
        dialogue between Maier’s world and our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        While alchemy is no longer part of modern science, perhaps, it continues to appeal to many as a world we have
        lost. Some today are drawn to alchemy as a scientific discourse unafraid of reaching for the most profound
        divine or cosmic wisdom, while others might value Atalanta fugiens for its elevation of play as a productive
        epistemology, in contrast to our more sober modern science. For our part, we appreciate <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> for the way that it invites readers, viewers, listeners, and singers into an early modern
        landscape of knowledge, where a singer and an alchemist might have more in common than we might think, and where
        a golden apple might cause us all to pause, to tarry, and to consider nature’s secrets.

      <h2>Author Biography</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Tara Nummedal</strong> is Associate Professor of History at Brown University, were she teaches courses
        in early modern European history and the history of science. She is the author of <em>Anna Zieglerin and the
          Lion's Blood: Alchemy and End Times in Reformation Germany</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2019) and
        <em>Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2007). She is also the
        co-author, with Janice Neri and John V. Calhoun, of <em>John Abbot and William Swainson: Art, Science, and
          Commerce in Nineteenth-Century Natural History</em> (University of Alabama Press, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Donna Bilak</strong> holds a Ph.D. from the Bard Graduate Center. A historian of early modern alchemy,
        she specializes in the study of emblematics. Her research interests extend to jewelry history and technology,
        which draw upon her previous professional experience in Toronto's jewelry industry as a designer and wax model
        maker. Her scholarship centers on material practices of humanism both in the early modern period and in
        contemporary society; namely, how intersections of text, images, and the creative and experimental use of
        materials come together in the creation and application of knowledge.
