        This essay discusses a significant component of alchemical discourse in the early modern period, the relations between alchemy and myth. The literary genre of what has been called Hermetic Mythology, or, more recently, mythoalchemy, worked on the premise that the myths of Egyptian, Greek, and Latin antiquity were repositories of alchemical secrets, coded narratives of natural philosophy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For references to “Hermetic Mythology,” see Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 52; Read, <em>Through Alchemy to Chemistry</em>, 64–67. On the German term “Mythoalchemie,” see Telle, “Mythologie und Alchemie.”'>1</a></sup>
        Early signs of this could already be seen in late medieval alchemical works like the fourteenth-century
        <em>Pretiosa margarita novella</em> (New Pearl of Great Price) of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara, but it was to develop
        further following the Renaissance upsurge in interest in classical antiquity, finding its flowering in the
        alchemical emblem literature of Michael Maier. Maier promotes the alchemical interpretation of mythology early
        in his publishing career, introducing a discussion of the alchemical significance of <em>Hieroglyphica
          Aegyptio-Graeca</em> (Greco-Egyptian Hieroglyphs) in his first major publication, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>
        (Most Secret Secrets, 1614). His conviction of the alchemical exegesis of ancient myth was to find its most
        vibrant visual and verbal expression several years later in his elaborate multimedia <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        (Atalanta fleeing, 1618). Opening with an introduction to the early history of mythoalchemy, this essay then
        concentrates on Maier’s mythoalchemical works, arguing that it is not the visually flamboyant <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> but rather the richly intertextual <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> that lies at the heart of Maier’s
        mytho-chymical project.

        Learned alchemists had long been condemnatory of those who naively read alchemical literature in an overly
        literal way. Catholic practitioners at times explicitly advocated an interpretative approach that drew
        inspiration from the multiple levels of biblical exegesis of holy scripture. Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596), for
        example, was drawn to the exegetical techniques of Jewish Kabbalah, in the conviction that even the most
        banal-seeming passages in scripture held unexpected treasures concealed in their depths.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Vigenère, <em>Traicté du feu</em>, 164. See also de Planis Campy, <em>L’Ouverture de l’escolle</em>.'>2</a></sup>
        Even though Luther had called for a return to the literal reading of scripture, this did not discourage
        Protestant alchemists like Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605) from theosophical speculations on multiple levels of
        alchemical, magical, and cabalistic reading of material.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Forshaw, “Vitriolic Reactions,” 117.'>3</a></sup> Others, while quick to reject the
        idolatrous paganism of classical mythology, argued that the tales of the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman gods held
        far more valuable secrets, hidden from the profane, not to be taken literally but plumbed to their depths for
        lessons: moral, ethical, philosophical, political, or in the case of some, alchemical.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Seznec, <em>Survival of the Pagan Gods</em>; Allen, <em>Mysteriously Meant</em>.'>4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some ancient Greek alchemical texts are attributed to mythical figures (Hermes, Agathodaemon, and
        Isis), Greek alchemists, such as Zosimos of Panopolis, Olympiodoros, or Stephanos of Alexandria, do not seem to
        have shown much interest in incorporating references to classical mythology in their symbolic language, let
        alone alchemical interpretations of Egyptian or Greek mythical material.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Berthelot, <em>Origines de l’alchimie</em>, ch. 2; Didier Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 166. Olympiodorus does, however, make use of the myths in the Orphica in his account of the dismemberment of Dionysus and creation of mankind. See, however, Edmonds, <em>Redefining Ancient Orphism</em>, 389–90 for a brief discussion of alchemical allegory in the context of Olympiodorus’ use of the myths in the Orphica, such as his recounting of the myth of the Titans’ dismemberment of Dionysus and the subsequent creation of humankind. Matton, “L’Interprétation alchimique,” 74.'>5</a></sup>
        The first sign we have of such a notion is from the seventh-century CE Byzantine chronicler John of Antioch, who
        “evoked an alchemical interpretation of the <em>Golden Fleece</em>,” arguing that it was “a book written on
        parchment teaching the reader how to make gold through alchemy; which was the real motivation for the quest of
        the Argonauts.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 166.'>6</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea was sustained by the tenth-century lexicographer Suda, who recorded that “the Golden fleece was not
        what the fable says of it, but a book written on a skin and which taught the manner of making gold by alchemy.
        That is why the ancients rightly called it ‘The Golden Fleece’ because of what it enabled one to
        achieve.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Matton, “L’Interprétation alchimique,” 74.'>7</a></sup> Sylvain Matton reports that
        something similar was repeated by the Greek scholar Archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica (c. 1115–1195/96), who
        adds that “[Alexandrou] Kharax himself says that the Golden Fleece is a treatise of chrysography written on
        parchment, for which reason, in the measure that it was a thing of considerable importance, the ship the
        <em>Argo</em> was constructed [for Jason and the Argonauts].”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Matton, “L’Interprétation alchimique,” 74.'>8</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais (1184/94–c.1264), compiler of the <em>Speculum maius</em>
        (Greater Mirror), numbered Virgil amongst the masters of Alchemy, the first medieval consideration of Greek
        mythology in a “<em>sensus chymicus</em>” [chymical sense]—with the idea that the transformations of men and
        animals in, for example, Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> and Virgil’s <em>Georgics</em> and <em>Aeneid</em>, could
        be seen as analogies for the transmutation of metals—is found in the fourteenth century. This work is Petrus
        Bonus of Ferrara’s <em>Pretiosa margarita novella</em>, a work predating the <em>Genealogia deorum
          gentilium</em> (Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles, 1360), the famous mythographical work of his compatriot
        Boccaccio (1313–1375).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Telle, “Mythologie und Alchemie,” 138; Telle, <em>Alchemie und Poesie</em>, 87; Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 49. See also Mulryan, “Renaissance Mythographers.”'>9</a></sup>
        There Bonus writes of “a certain gold hidden in Ovid” [<em>aurum in Ovidio occultatum</em>], with reference to
        the tales of the shape-shifting sea-god Proteus; the petrifying Gorgon, Medusa; and the goddess Minerva; to
        Theseus and the Minotaur in his labyrinth; to Aeneas and the golden bough; to Jason, Medea, and the Golden
        Fleece.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='This passage does not appear in the early published editions (Venice, 1546; Venice, 1547), but it does appear in the fifth volume of Zetzner’s <em>Theatrum chemicum</em> (1622), 686, and in the second volume of Manget’s <em>Bibliotheca chemica curiosa</em> (1702), 43. On the former, see Willard, “Metamorphoses of Metals,” 153; on the latter, see Kühlmann, “Sinnbilder der Transmutationskunst,” 165.'>10</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        With the upsurge of interest in Greek and Roman antiquity during the Renaissance, classical mythology and the
        “poetic theology” of the “ancient theologians” Orpheus, Hesiod, and Homer came to be valued as repositories of
        the secrets of natural philosophy. At a time when the Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499)
        expounded on the mysteries to be discovered in the <em>Corpus hermeticum</em> (Hermetic Corpus) and the works of
        Plato and the Neoplatonists, the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (1455–1536) composed an alchemical
        exegesis of two Labors of Hercules as part of his unpublished treatise <em>De magia</em> (On Magic).<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 167.'>11</a></sup> In
        1515, Ficino’s friend Giovanni Aurelio Augurelli (1441–1524) gave an alchemical meaning to a number of classical
        myths, such as the love affairs of Mars and Venus, or the quest for the Golden Fleece, in his alchemical
        neo-Latin poem <em>Chrysopoeia</em> (The Art of Making Gold).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 167, 170. See also Haskell, “Round and Round We Go,” 585–606.'>12</a></sup>
        Just over a decade later, in <em>De auro</em> (On Gold, 1527), Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola (1469–1533)
        compared accounts of Jason’s quest for the Golden Fleece from the third-century BCE Greek epic poem the
        <em>Argonautica</em> of Apollonius of Rhodes, and the pseudepigraphic fourth- or sixth-century CE
        <em>Argonautica orphica</em> (Orphic Argonautica).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Faivre, <em>Western Esotericism</em>, 49; Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 172.'>13</a></sup>
        His conclusion was that “Jason sailed to Colchis on the quest of the Argonauts to seize not the golden sheepskin
        of Phrygia, but a parchment of ram’s membrane on which the process of making gold was described.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Pico della Mirandola, <em>Opus aureum de auro</em>, 324. Quoted in Willard, “Metamorphoses of Metals,” 156. See also <em>Theatrum chemicum</em>, vol. 2 (1602), 371.'>14</a></sup>
        Without a doubt, the tale of the Golden Fleece (Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em> 7.9–424) was one of the most
        popular mythoalchemical themes, with its vivid images of Jason ploughing the fire-breathing bulls and sowing the
        teeth of the dragon that guarded the fleece, each episode signifying “the practice of this Arte, daungers and
        perrills in this worke, the purging and preparing of the matters and substaunce of the medicine.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Faivre, <em>Toison d’or et alchimie</em> or the translation, <em>The Golden Fleece and Alchemy</em>. Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 167, citing Richard Bostocke, <em>The Difference betwene the Auncient Phisicke</em> [. . .] <em>and the latter Phisicke</em> (1585), quoted in Debus, “Myth, Allegory, and Scientific Truth,” 20.'>15</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the mid-sixteenth century, alchemical works began to appear that dealt with mythological material in some
        depth, notable examples being two works by the Italian physician and alchemist Giovanni Bracesco (1482–1555):
        <em>Il legno della vita</em> (The Wood of Life, 1542) and <em>La espositione di Geber</em> (The Explanation of
        Geber, 1544). In the latter he explicitly writes of how Jupiter’s transformation into a shower of gold
        represents the distillation of philosophical gold; the transformation of Argos’ eyes into a peacock’s tail
        intimates of the color changes of philosophical sulfur; the petrifying gaze of Medusa means the fixation of the
        elixir; the fable of the phoenix, repeatedly reborn, signifies the multiplication of the elixir; the tale of
        Daedalus and Icarus represents the processes of putrefaction and distillation; while the flight of Atalanta,
        chased by Hippomenes, is the coagulation of quicksilver with sulfur.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Telle, “Mythologie und Alchemie,” 147; Matton, “L’Interprétation alchimique,” 77–78.'>16</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In response, the <em>Mythologiae, sive explicationis fabularum libri X</em> (Ten Books of Mythology, or the
        Explanation of Fables, 1568), of the prominent mythographer Natale Conti (1520–1582) dismisses the
        interpretations of Bracesco as aberrant, but notes that they are approved by numerous alchemists.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Matton, “L’Interprétation alchimique,” 78; Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 174.'>17</a></sup>
        By this time, however, there was a long tradition of alchemical allegorical tales, such as the Duenech Allegory
        and the Allegory of Merlin, and the disdain of mythographers and lexicographers did little to deflate the
        enthusiasm of alchemists.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 169 for reference to “Merlini allegoria, & alterius de Duenech.” See also Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 121, Emblem 28 concerning “King Duenech”; 210, Emblem 50, for reference to the story of Merlin; and Maier, <em>Tractatus de volucri arborea</em>, 144–45 on Merlin being born of an incubus.'>18</a></sup>
        In fact, the first systematic and most extensive collection of mythoalchemy dates from the same period, in the
        <em>Auriloquio</em> (Golden Discourse) manuscript by Vincenzo Percolla (d. 1572), which deals with 209
        alchemical interpretations of mythological themes.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        And so we come to the work of Michael Maier (1568–1622), who studied philosophy and medicine at the university
        of Rostock from 1587 to 1591, obtained his Masters in Frankfurt in 1592, and then spent 1595 and 1596 in Padua,

        doctorate in medicine in Basel, with graduation theses on epilepsy in 1596.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 59.'>21</a></sup> In 1608 he moved to the
        Bohemian capital of Prague, where the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II was the magnet for all alchemists, cabalists,
        and magicians. He formally entered Rudolf’s service the following year, 1609, when he was 40 years old, as
        personal physician and imperial counsellor. Maier’s first publication, <em>De medicina regia</em> (On Royal
        Medicine, 1609), dates from that period. In that work he draws from medieval European authors Geber, Arnold of
        Villanova, and Hortulanus Anglicus, author of the well-known commentary on the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em>
        (Emerald Tablet) of Hermes Trismegistus.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 32, 69.'>22</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In April 1611 Maier left Rudolf’s Catholic court and went in search of a new patron, courting the favor of the
        Calvinist princes of Germany, eventually spending the next five years in England, in and around the court of
        James I (1566–1625). It is worth noting that Maier arrived shortly after the first performance of the English
        playwright Ben Jonson’s satire <em>The Alchemist</em>, complete with alchemical interpretations of the myth of
        the golden fleece, by the King’s Men in 1610.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Bensaude-Vincent and Stengers, <em>A History of Chemistry</em>, 24.'>23</a></sup> In
        <em>The Alchemist</em> we read, for instance, “I have a peece of Jasons fleece, too, Which was no other, than a
        book of alchemie, Writ in large sheepe-skin, a good fat ram-vellam,” of the fiery bulls as the alchemical
        furnace, the dragon as quicksilver, its teeth as mercury sublimate, and Jason’s helm as the alembic.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Jonson, <em>The Alchemist</em>, 2.1.105–7.'>24</a></sup>
        Perhaps Jonson’s play stimulated Maier’s imagination. Maier’s first major work, <em>Arcana arcanissima, hoc est,
          hieroglyphica Aegyptio-Graeca</em> (Most Secret Secrets, that is, Greco-Egyptian Hieroglyphs, 1614), allegedly
        first published in London by Thomas Creede (fl. 1593–1617), is certainly a venture into the relations between
        alchemy and mythology.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='This place and publisher are proposed by Figala and Neumann, “Michael Maier (1569–1622),” 37n11. See also Leibenguth, <em>Hermetische Poesie</em>, 489. Hofmeier, in <em>Michael Maiers Chymisches Cabinet</em> (30) points out that <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> was published with two different title pages, suggesting that Thomas Creede was responsible for both. <em>Arcana arcanissma</em> appears to have been published with the figurative title page in London by Thomas Creede in 1614. An edition without the title page images seems to have been published, possibly in Oppenheim, the same year. On Oppenheim as place of publication, see, for example, Manning, <em>The Emblem</em>, 280.'>25</a></sup>
        As Maier makes his disapproval of the false claims of gold-making <em>Alcumia</em> and his favor of genuine
        iatrochemical <em>chymia</em> perfectly clear in this early publication, and was to repeat this distinction in
        later works, perhaps, strictly speaking, we should here be speaking of “mytho-chymia” rather than
        mythoalchemy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The figurative title page of <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> gives a clear sense of its subject matter (<strong>fig.
          1</strong>). At the top we find the three central figures of the Egyptian myth of the dismemberment of Osiris
        by his brother Typhon, the pieces collected and reassembled by their sister Isis. At the bottom of the page we
        have three creatures associated with Egyptian mythology: the Ibis and Cynocephalus or baboon, both linked with
        the god Thoth, identified with Hermes in Greek mythology and Mercury in Latin; the third creature is the sacred
        bull Apis. Flanking the title we find two figures from Greek mythology: on the left, Hercules, and on the right,
        Dionysus.

        The <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> is divided into six books, which give a clear sense of Maier’s conviction of the
        underlying message of ancient myth: 1) On the Hieroglyphical Egyptian Gods (Osiris, Isis, Mercury, Vulcan,
        Typhon, etc.) and the mythic activities and characters of singular creatures; 2) On the allegories of the
        Greeks, primarily golden, such as Jason’s golden fleece, the golden apples of the Hesperides; 3) On the
        fictitious, philosophical or Chymico-medical golden genealogy of gods and goddesses; 4) On festivals and holy
        occasions, games, instituted in honor of this science; 5) On the Labors of Hercules and their meanings in
        relation to the art of alchemy; 6) On alchemical interpretations of the Iliad and the Odyssey.<sup><a href="#"

            data-text-content='Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 53. “Lib. 1 De Dijs Aegyptijs Hieroglyphicis, Osiride, Iside, Mercurio, Vulcano, Typhone, &c. . . .  Lib. 2.

      </p>
      <p>
        Maier is careful to criticize paganism, and to emphasize Christ’s role as the true Savior Physician, but
        nevertheless emphasizes the value of the chymical secrets lying behind the myths. He repeatedly reminds his
        readers that these tales should not be taken as histories, but are instead hieroglyphs or allegories, that is,
        tales “concealing some deeper meaning, philosophical or moral, which must be withheld from those persons too
        ignorant or too impious to use it aright.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 2, 8, 11; Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 48.'>28</a></sup>
        According to Maier, the Egyptian priests transmitted their knowledge of the Chymical Artifice in this way so as
        to only reveal it to the most worthy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 12.'>29</a></sup> In support of this multilayered
        reading, as a devout Lutheran he avoids mentioning Catholic fourfold exegesis of scripture, but discusses
        instead the accustomed fourfold reading of the works of Homer, with Hieroglyphical, Political, Poetical, and
        Grammatical levels of consideration.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 280.'>30</a></sup> The ancient Roman scholar Marcus
        Terentius Varro (116–27 BCE) is also mentioned as one who spoke of almost all the classical gods as “elements of
        the macrocosm” (thereby tacitly renouncing a plurality of gods), with Saturn, for example, representing the
        Heavens or Form, and Rhea the Earth or Matter.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 98–99.'>31</a></sup> Suda's belief that the Golden
        Fleece was a “book or membrane containing Chrysopoeia” is introduced into the argument.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 68.'>32</a></sup> But the “Most
        Secret Secret” is that mythology is all about chymia, transmitted by means of hieroglyphical letters or pictures
        of animals, from the Egyptians to the Greeks, and the truest interpretation is that it all concerns the
        “Philosophical Medicine,” the “golden Medicine, acting as golden medicament of the body and spirit.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 264; Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 29; “Nempe Medicinam auream de aureo animi & corporis medicamento agentem: ad Medicinam Philosophicam, & nihil aliud quam artificium summum Chymicum et Arcanum Arcanissimum ab Aegyptiis ad Graecos translatum.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 68–69.'>33</a></sup>
        Maier introduces his reader to the four principal “Hieroglyphical Gods of the Egyptians,” namely Osiris or the
        Sun, and Isis or the Moon, as brother and sister; “Mercurius,” who joins with the Sun and Moon, as common to
        both; and finally, the “burning spirit,” Typhon (i.e., Set), not classed as a god, but as a malign demon, who
        chopped his twin brother Osiris into “most fine parts” [<em>tenuissimas partes</em>].<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 3.'>34</a></sup> In addition to
        these four, Maier lists a decidedly Latin-sounding group of Egyptian deities: Vulcan (external fire), Pallas
        (Wisdom of Operating), Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Apollo, Pluto, and the rest. Elsewhere Maier introduces Horus as
        one of the most ancient gods, preceding a list of twelve Greco-Roman deities, six male and six female, with
        reference to the mythographer Natale Conti.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 57.'>35</a></sup> Maier argues that the ancient poets
        wanted to show that “those Gods did not exist, except as fictitious [and] imaginary, but were symbols and
        emblems, some for the eye, others for the mind, hidden to the vulgar, but known to themselves.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Deos illos non esse nisi ficticios, imaginarios et artis occultae vulgo, sed sibi notae, symbola et Emblemata aliud ad oculum, aliud ad mentem referentia.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 59. See Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 83.'>36</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier is most interested in the “Chymical Gods” [Dij Chymici], or indeed the “principal intellectual chymical
        gods” [<em>praecipui dij intellectuales chymici</em>]: Osiris, Isis, Mercurius, and Vulcanus, who are not
        celestial but rather subterranean, born of the art. Egyptian Isis is identified as Greek Ceres, and Osiris as
        Bacchus or Dionysus, “chief of the golden gods” [<em>aureorum deorum primarius</em>].<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 6, 33, 38, 90.'>37</a></sup> Osiris
        is explained to symbolize the “matter of the art, from which the golden Medicine is composed”; his death
        represents the alchemical process of “solution”; the tomb in which his dismembered body is placed by the “fiery
        and furious spirit” [<em>spiritus igneus & furiosus</em>] Typhon is the alchemical vessel.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 12, 10.'>38</a></sup> After this
        solution, Isis collects the parts and unites them with combustible sulfur, such that the soul of Osiris becomes
        sufficiently ardent that he converts Isis, mother—wife—sister, into himself, resulting in the ultimate
        hermaphroditic or androgynous perfection.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 12.'>39</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> contains a multitude of alchemical interpretations of mythological motifs; here,
        a scant few will have to suffice. On the grounds of Egyptian myth, the “black bull” Apis is “a hieroglyphic and
        indubitable character of the true and unique Philosophical Matter,” the “<em>Chaos philosophicum</em>,”
        containing all things. This is backed up with reference to Greek motifs, from the bulls of Minos, the story of
        Theseus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur in the Cretan labyrinth; Hercules’ fight with the three-bodied (or
        three-headed) giant Geryon, and Jason’s yoking of the fire-breathing bulls.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Est autem bos niger Hieroglyphicus et indubitatus character materiae verae et unicae Philosophicae.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 33.'>40</a></sup>
        The god Pan, as well as the Satyrs, including Silenus, companion of Dionysus, represent the “vileness, wildness,
        or rawness of philosophical matter.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . vilitas et sylvestritas seu ruditas materiae philosophicae.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 91.'>41</a></sup>
        The “story of the birth, struggle and victory of Dionysus graphically depicts the whole Philosophical artifice,”
        hence his appearance on the title page.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Haec narratio de Dionysi ortu, bello & victoria totum artificium Philosophicum graphice depingit.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 149. Cf. 202, 204–5.'>42</a></sup>
        Osiris’ deadly brother Typhon has an affinity with serpents and dragons, which is “proven” by Maier through the
        anagrammatical “transposition” of the letters of his name to “Python,” adversary of Apollo.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Draco, serpens aut Python, nempe illa aqua foetida quae putrescit.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 204.'>43</a></sup>
        Alchemically, Typhon represents “that foetid water that putrefies,” a “sulfurous and burning spirit,” while his
        wife Echidna denotes the “watery and cold flowing substance,” i.e., quicksilver.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Typhon sulphureum et ardentem spiritum, Echidna aquosam & frigidam volubilem substantiam denotat.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 82.'>44</a></sup>
        From their union arise the various mineral species, represented by their large brood of monstrous offspring,
        including Cerberus, the Sphinx, Chimaera, Hydra, and the hundred-headed dragon Ladon, guardian of the golden
        apples of the Hesperides.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 81–82.'>45</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Much is said concerning Mercury, inventor of letters, numbers, musical instruments and intervals, observer of
        the courses of the stars, and psychopomp.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 5, 58, 138.'>46</a></sup> While the lame god of the
        forge, Vulcan, is associated with fiery lions, Mercury is connected with dragons and serpents, such as the male
        and female snakes entwined around his caduceus.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 119–120.'>47</a></sup> The wand represents his
        marvelous ability to reduce all dissident things to concord, whence the famous alchemical dictum, <em>Est in
          Mercurio quicquid quaerunt sapientes</em> [There is in Mercury whatever the wisemen seek].<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 128, 130, 136.'>48</a></sup> In
        line with a multitude of other alchemists, Maier considers Mercurius to be the “subject of the chymical art,”
        indeed describing him with the extremely Christ-like epithet “<em>Omnia in Omnibus</em>” [All in All
        things].<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . subjectum artis chymicae sit Mercurius.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 135; Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 140. Cf. <em>Colossians</em> 3:11; <em>Ephesians</em> 1:23; 1 <em>Corinthians</em> 12:6, 15:28.'>49</a></sup>
        In an entertaining piece of cod-etymology, we discover that the Egyptians called Mercury in their tongue
        <em>Theut</em>, with whom the Germans are connected, calling themselves “<em>Theut</em>onos sive
        <em>Theut</em>schen” [Teutonic or Deutsch].<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 142.'>50</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another major figure in <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> is the demi-god Hercules, son of Zeus and Alcmene, famous
        for his twelve Labors. While his father represents the internal agent of the art, its principal subject, Maier
        explains that Hercules is the external agent, the artifex himself.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 216, 241.'>51</a></sup> A whole book is devoted to
        the chymical interpretation of the Labors of Hercules, many of which easily connect with traditional alchemical
        symbolism: his first task was to slay the Nemean Lion, which was neither Asian nor African but celestial, and
        ultimately alchemical, with Maier adducing the Green Lion of the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em> (Rose Garden of
        the Philosophers, 1550), Senior’s parable of the Hunting of the Lion, and the <em>Consilium conjugii</em>’s
        (Advice on the Conjuction) explanation that Leo is the <em>Sol inferius</em> [Lower Sun].<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 219–20.'>52</a></sup> Hercules’
        combat with the watery serpent, the Lernaean Hydra, is likewise identified as alchemical, with Basil Valentine’s
        <em>De occulta philosophia</em> (On Occult Philosophy) cited with reference to Mercury as a serpent from
        waters.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 224.'>53</a></sup> In a similar fashion, Hercules’
        task of obtaining the golden apples of the Hesperides, guarded by the 100-headed dragon, Ladon, is another labor
        amenable to alchemical interpretation.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 77, 80.'>54</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier in fact identifies three Greek heroes as representatives of the alchemical artifex: Hercules, Jason, and
        Odysseus.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content=' Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 216, 262-63. '>55</a></sup> Jason’s quest with the
        Argonauts for the Golden Fleece, interpreted as “the Philosophical Stone, the highest medicine of human bodies,”
        is one of the best-known myths.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 42; “Lapis Philosophicus, summa medicina corporum humanorum.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 74.'>56</a></sup>
        Maier explains that Jason was assisted by the sorceress Medea, who made four potions [<em>pharmaca</em>]: 1) an
        unguent that protected his body from the dragon’s lethal fire and venom, as well as the fiery breath of the
        bulls; 2) a soporific narcotic to put the dragon to sleep, so that he could steal the fleece; 3) a limpid water
        that extinguished the bull’s fire; 4) a special image of the Sun and Moon, which he wore around his neck, for
        success in the work.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 64–65; Maier suggests that the talisman was a pentacle, 76.'>57</a></sup>
        In keeping with his insistence that true chymia concerns the Golden Medicine, Maier etymologically presents
        Jason’s name as a fitting example of nominative determinism: “for the name expresses healer, from
        <em>Iasthai</em> or healing; for <em>Iasis</em> is the art of healing.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Iason . . . Nomen enim medicum exprimit, ἀπὶ τοῦ ἰασθαι seu à medendo dictum; Ιάσις enim ars est medendi.” Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 69.'>58</a></sup>
        Jason, like Hercules, was educated in healing by the centaur Chiron, from whom he gained manual experience, just
        as he gained the necessary advice and theory for the perfect completion of the work from Medea.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, 69.'>59</a></sup> Jason represents
        the “Medicus Philosophus,” while Medea represents “most outstanding assistance,” or reason.<sup><a href="#"

        reading of myth was thus not only used for examples of interactions between alchemical substances, but also
        concerned the relationship between theory and practice. Again, Maier could cite alchemical authorities, such as
        Pseudo-Lull’s <em>Testamentum</em> (Testament), in support of his interpretation of the allegorical
        interpretations, for example “the Dragon, i.e. Fire, in which is our golden Stone, lives in all things.”<sup><a

        Only someone blinder than a mole, Maier argues, would not see that these are all chymical fables.<sup><a

      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning of 1616 Maier returned to the continent, and the next few years were to see a flurry of
        publications. 1616 saw the appearance of <em>De circulo physico quadrato, hoc est, auro eiusque virtute
          medicinali</em> (On the Natural Circle Squared, i.e., Gold and its medicinal virtue), closely followed by
        <em>Lusus serius, quo Hermes sive Mercurius rex mundanorum Omnium, &c. judicatus & constitutus</em> (A Serious
        Jest [or: Game], by which Hermes or Mercurius is judged and appointed King of All Worldly Things, &c.), which
        appeared the same year. Neither of these works was as intent on mytho-chymia as the <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>,
        but both include mythological references.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, 19 (Vulcan, Neptune, Jupiter and Pluto as symbols of the four elements); 59–60 (Golden Fleece and Jason as a Healer). <em>Lusus serius</em> includes two of Maier’s favorite mythemes: Minerva’s birth from the head of Jupiter (4) and Jupiter sending forth his eagles from Delphi (67).'>64</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The following year, in 1617, there appeared the <em>Examen fucorum pseudo-chymicorum</em> (Swarm of
        Pseudo-Chymical Drones).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Its dedicatory letter is dated September 1616, the same month as the <em>Lusus serius</em>.'>65</a></sup>
        There we find one or two mythological references—for example, one to Saturn throwing up a Stone that he had
        previously swallowed thinking it was his rival Jupiter, and another to the golden apples of the
        Hesperides—although the focus of the work is on fraudulent alchemical practice, for which he borrows heavily
        from Heinrich Khunrath’s pseudonymous <em>Treuhertzige Warnungs-Vermahnung</em> (Sincere Warning-Admonition),
        appended to <em>Vom hylealischen Chaos</em> (On Primaterial Chaos, 1597).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Examen fucorum</em>, 9 (Saturn), 23 (apples). Maier refers the reader to “nostris Hieroglyphicis,” i.e. <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> (15). On Khunrath, see Karpenko, 98ff.'>66</a></sup>
        Published around the same time, the <em>Jocus severus</em> (A Serious Joke, 1617), is an allegorical account of
        a tribunal of birds set up to judge the Night owl (Noctua), associated with the goddess of wisdom, and for Maier
        a symbol of <em>Chemia</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Jocus severus</em>, 4.'>67</a></sup> Again there are brief references to myth,
        one from the mouth of the Swallow (Philomela), doubtless emboldened by the criticisms of Natale Conti, claiming
        that chymia is full of fables and that those of the poets concern hidden chymical matters, rather than moral
        lessons.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Jocus severus</em>, 29.'>68</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then followed the <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em> (Symbols of the Golden Table, 1617), introducing a cosmopolitan
        lineage of alchemists from twelve different nations, ranging from the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus in antiquity
        to the modern “Anonymous Pole,” i.e., Michael Sendivogius (1566-1636).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, (:)4rff. The date of the dedicatory letter, December 1616, helps us establish a timeline for Maier’s 1617 publications.'>69</a></sup>
        Contrary to his treatment of the ancient gods, who are explained as fictions, Maier emphasizes that Hermes
        Trismegistus is most definitely not a “fictitious person” [<em>personam fictitiam</em>] but a most ancient
        Egyptian Philosopher.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 6.'>70</a></sup> In his discussion of Hermes,
        Maier returns to material discussed in <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, including the myths of Apis, Osiris, Isis,
        and so forth as representatives of the Egyptian Chymical Gods; he references in particular the myth of the
        Golden Fleece, with Jason as the “physician with subtle stratagems” and Medea as “Counsel of Theoretical
        Reason.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 9; “Dii Aegyptionem chymici.” Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 25; “Iason, id est, medicus subtili strategemate, ex Medeae, hoc est, Rationis Theoreticae consilio.” Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 35.'>71</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        While happy to discover chymical truth in pagan mythology, and indeed to go along with those, like Lodovico
        Lazzarelli (1447–1500), who find a Christian message in analogical readings of Hermetic works, Maier criticizes
        those who “most impiously and sacrilegiously” attempt alchemical readings of the “Creation of the world,
        nativity, passion, death, resurrection and ascension of Christ.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Verum cum nonullos videamus Hermetis verba analogice accipere, ut certum est de Lazarelo (qui facit idola Apostolos, fictorem hominem Christum, virtute inditam, Spiritum Sanctum &c.) nos illa similiter eodem sensu, sed ad philosophiam potius, quam theologiam, hoc est, Chemiam interpretabimur.” Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 14; “ . . . qui hoc nostro tempore Creationem mundi, nativitatem, passionem, mortem, resurrectionem & ascensionem Christi, imo fere omnes articulos fidei, sacrilege & impiissime ad Chymicam artem transferre conantur.” Maier, <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>, 24.'>72</a></sup>
        Another of Maier’s publications from the same year may help explain this stance. In 1617 Maier publishes his
        first <em>apologium</em> for the Rosicrucians, <em>Silentium post clamores</em> (Silence after the Clamors),
        following the appearance of the three Rosicrucian manifestos, <em>Fama fraternitatis</em> (Rumor of the
        Brotherhood, 1614), <em>Confessio fraternitatis R. C.</em> (Confession of the Brotherhood, 1615) and
        <em>Chymische Hochzeit</em> (Chemical Wedding, 1616).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Fama</em> explicitly condemns “books and figures [that] have been brought out under the name of chymia,
        which are <em>in Contumeliam gloriae Dei</em> [an insult to God’s glory].”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . unter den Chymischen Nahmen sein Bücher und Figuren außkommen / in Contumeliam gloriae Dei.” <em>Fama fraternitatis</em>, 126.'>73</a></sup>
        Similar sentiments are expressed in the <em>Confessio</em>: “we must earnestly admonish you, that you cast away,
        if not all, yet most of the worthless books of pseudo-chymists, to whom it is a game to apply the Most Holy
        Trinity to vain things, or a joke to deceive men with monstrous figures and enigmas.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . illud serio inculcamus, abijciendos esse, si non omnes, plerosque tamen Pseudochymicorum nequam libellos; quibus vel SS. Triade ad futilia abuti lusus: vel monstrosis figuris atque aenigmatibus homines decipere jocus.” <em>Confessio Fraternitatis R. C</em>., 11v–12r.'>74</a></sup>
        The same point is driven home in the <em>Chymische Hochzeit</em>, when the pseudo-chymists are separated from
        true practitioners: “you have forged false and spurious books, fooled and swindled others, thereby lowering the
        royal dignity in everyone’s eyes. You also know what blasphemous and seductive pictures you have used, sparing
        not even the Holy Trinity, but using it for the cozening of one and all.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Godwin et al., <em>Rosicrucian Trilogy</em>, 99. See <em>Chymische Hochzeit</em>, 46: “Sie wüsten gründtlich wol / und weren in irem gewissen uberzeugt / daß sie Falsche erdichte Bücher geschmiedet / andere genarret / betrogen / und hierdurch Könighliche Ehr bey Männiglich geschmälert. So wüsten sie was Gottloser verfürische Figuren sie gebraucht. Da sie auch Göttlicher Dreyfaltigkeit nit verschonet / sondern sich derselben Land und Leut zu betriegen gebraucht.”'>75</a></sup>
        While Maier was comfortable with making references to the Egyptian gods, or to Hercules and Jason, and their
        chymical significance, his admiration for the Rosicrucian message must have convinced him to avoid drawing
        analogies between the Stone and Christ.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Silentium post clamores</em>, 37–29, 105, 140.'>76</a></sup> Perhaps, like the
        Catholics Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) and Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), he was concerned that such practices risked distorting scripture,
        “pass[ing] off the mysteries of our faith as natural things,” or making “alchemy the sole religion, the
        alchemist the sole religious person, and the tyrocinium of alchemy the sole catechism of the faith.”<sup><a

        Later that same year, there appears Maier’s best-known work, the <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, which has been
        described as “the strangest, the most beautiful and the most innovative work of esoteric alchemy in the
        seventeenth century,” the “finest of all those curious works which typify Hermetic mythology,” with its
        idiosyncratic combination of the “textual” and “representational” traditions of mythology, fifty emblems with
        accompanying discourses, together with fifty musical fugues.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The elaborate title page presents elements of the myth—found in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> and Hyginus’
        <em>Fables</em>—of the fleet-footed huntress Atalanta who could run faster than the East Wind and was only
        prepared to marry a man who could beat her in a foot race, slow suitors only being fit for target practice
        (<strong>fig. 2</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        Atalanta was eventually bested by Hippomenes, who outran her by dropping three golden apples, given to him by
        Venus, in order to distract her from the contest. At the foot of the page we see the Bridal Race with Hippomenes
        running for his life (and wife) and clutching two of the golden apples, while Atalanta stoops to pick up the
        first. The Author’s Preface at the start of the work succinctly explains the basic alchemical significance of
        the myth: Atalanta has the volatile nature of quicksilver while Hippomenes has the fiery nature of
        sulfur.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2].'>80</a></sup> In medieval
        <em>chrysopoeia</em> or gold-making alchemy, these were the two ingredients necessary for the creation of gold
        and the philosophers’ stone. At bottom right, we see the happy couple consummating their union in the Temple of
        Cybele—code for the alchemical athanor or furnace—for which profanation they were punished by being turned into
        the lions that pulled the goddess’ chariot.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

          three nymphs Aegle, Arethusa, and Hespertusa. The apples are guarded by the dragon Ladon, child of Typhon and

        Close reading of the text and viewing of the images will reveal that Maier’s title page anticipates themes in
        the book. There are three emblems, for example, concerned with Venus (<span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"

        deal of the material already introduced in the 285-page <em>Arcana arcanissima</em>, but this time with the
        addition of fifty high-quality engravings by Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593–1650), and the accompanying canons
        or fugues.

        Maier opens the work with an image of Boreas the North Wind, familiar to readers from <em>Metamorphoses</em>
        6.675–721, carrying a fetus in his belly, alluding to the line from the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em> “The Wind
        bore it in its belly” (<strong>fig. 4</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 13. Maier modifies the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em> as found in Khunrath, <em>Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae</em>, “Pyramid” engraving: “Portavit illud ventus in ventre suo” [The Wind carried it in its belly], changing it from an impersonal “it” to a personal “him”: “Portavit eum ventus in ventre suo.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 13.'>84</a></sup>
        In this way Maier cleverly creates an amalgam of classical mythological material and medieval and early modern
        alchemical matter. His openness to multiple levels of interpretation is evident from his commentary on this
        first image:

        Here Maier is probably challenging readers to flesh out his observations. Some at least would have known that
        Boreas is the father of two of the Argonauts, hence a connection with the mythoalchemical fable par excellence,
        Jason’s quest for the Golden Fleece. The distinctly unnatural womb for the fetus, Sulfur, would have caused some
        readers to think of the story of Dionysus whose mother, Semele, perished in a blaze of divine fire. His father,
        Zeus, rescued the unborn child and sewed him into his thigh, where he remained in incubation until ready to be
        born.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      </p>
      <p>
        Not all of Maier’s emblems are mytho-chymical; indeed, many contain little or no mythical material, but some
        stand out as particularly relevant. <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="12">Emblem
            12</a></span> is based on the tale of Saturn swallowing his offspring and includes a consideration of

            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="14">Emblem 14</a></span>, with the dragon devouring its tail, includes
        references to dragons, the Golden Fleece, the Garden of the Hesperides, plus equivalent discussion of dragon
        symbolism in alchemy from Pseudo-Lull and the most famous alchemical image sequence before the <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="41">Emblem 41</a></span>, on the death of Adonis, Maier
        explains that the wild boar is the “sharpest acid” [<em>acetum acerrimum</em>] that kills or dissolves philosophical
        gold.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 173.'>93</a></sup>
        Arguably <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ most mytho-chymical image is <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="44">Emblem 44</a></span>, concerning the dismemberment and reconstitution of Osiris. The
        accompanying discourse is replete with mythical Decknamen for substances, including a direct reference to
        Atalanta and Hippomenes.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 185.'>94</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier’s interest in mythical themes continues, unabated, in subsequent works. Although the <em>Tripus
          Aureus</em> (Golden Tripod, 1618) is his edition of others' alchemical works, including his translation of the
        English alchemist Thomas Norton’s <em>Ordinall of Alchemy</em>, mythical references to Apollo and Diana, for
        instance, can be found in the pages of Basil Valentine’s <em>Practica cum duodecim clavibus</em> (Twelve Keys).
        The title page of <em>Viatorium, hoc est, de montibus planetarum septem seu metallorum</em> (A Travel-Guide,
        that is, On the Mountains of the Seven Planets or Metals, 1618) features planetary deities as symbolic
        representations of the alchemical metals, with the authorial epigram comparing alchemists to Theseus lost in
        Minos’ Labyrinth and in need of Ariadne’s thread, with the explanation that the Minotaur at the center
        represents the “materia philosophica.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 56.'>95</a></sup> Maier returns to familiar mythemes,
        including the Golden Fleece and the apples of the Hesperides, tricorporeal Geryon, Typhon as Python, and
        Hercules’ fight with the Nemean Lion.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Viatorium</em>, 6, 56, 135.'>96</a></sup> The same can be said for Maier’s
        second Rosicrucian apology, the <em>Themis aurea</em> (Golden Themis, 1618), where he refers to the “most
        industrious Artifex and most skilled Philosopher, Hercules,” to Osiris and Dionysus as “Chymical subjects,” and
        to Ulysses as the “wandering artifex.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Herculem autem laboriosissimum Artificem & Philosophum exercitatissimum”; Osiris and Dionysus, “Chymica subiecta”; “Ulysses, seu errabundus artifex.” Maier, <em>Themis aurea,</em> 176–78.'>97</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <em>Verum inventum, hoc est, munera Germaniae</em> (The True Discovery, or, The Gifts of Germany, 1619),
        Maier briefly returns to Natale Conti’s <em>Mythologiae</em> in a discussion of Typhon as a fire-breathing
        serpent [<em>flammivomus serpens</em>], Pluto, and “infernal Cerberus” [<em>Cerberi infernalis</em>]; elsewhere
        he mentions Pallas’ aegis bearing the head of Medusa; Pegasus, who sprang from the gorgon’s blood, and the
        Chimera, together with their nemeses, Perseus and Bellerophon, as well as Atalanta, Hippomenes, and the golden
        apples.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Verum inventum</em>, 86–87, 92, 138–39.'>98</a></sup> Maier had already
        discussed the mythical phoenix in <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> and <em>Lusus serius</em>. He returns to the theme
        in <em>Tractatus de volucri arborea</em> (Treatise on the Arboreal Bird, 1619), together with references to
        Osiris and Typhon, the Labors of Hercules, the wanderings of Ulysses, Jason’s perils, Theseus’ deeds, golden
        apples, the flight of Atalanta, and Dionysus as philosophical fetus.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Tractatus de volucri arborea</em>, A6r, 107–10, 113–14, 141–43.'>99</a></sup>
        In <em>Septimana philosophica</em> (A Philosophical Week, 1620), he asks whether the herb Moly, which Mercury
        gave Ulysses to protect himself against the potions of Circe, has any chymical properties, together with
        considerations of the Nemean Lion, the trees of the Hesperides, the chymical symbolism of the ibis, dragons, and
        serpents.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier, <em>Septimana philosophica</em>, 174, 206, 210, 249, 265.'>100</a></sup> Maier’s
        “poetic swan-song,” the <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> (Intellectual Songs, 1622), proposes an
        interpretation of the three apples that Hippomenes threw in front of Atalanta.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The posthumously published <em>Ulysses</em> (1624) continues in the same vein, with references to the nymphs in
        the garden of the Hesperides, tales of the gods, and the fable of the Golden Fleece, all as “arcana Chymica”; and to

        Michael Maier is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in the story of mythoalchemy, both for the
        extensive and systematic approach to alchemical exegesis of Egyptian and Greek mythology in <em>Arcana
          arcanissima</em> and for the somewhat more episodic and erratic approach in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, where
        nuggets suddenly appear in the text to entertain and beguile the reader, like the fabled apples dropped to
        distract Atalanta. Although others before him had drawn inspiration from ancient myth in the course of their
        reflections on alchemical symbolism, it was Maier, physician, chemist, composer, and poet laureate, who had the
        mixed skillset and courtly background to initiate a multimedia work like the <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.
        Mythology was enjoying a vibrant cultural life in the early Baroque courts. Claudio Monteverdi and Alessandro
        Striggio’s opera, <em>Orfeo</em>, for instance, had its first performance before the court of Mantua in
        1607.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The composer had himself been interested in alchemy and had even been addressed as a “Great Professor of Chemistry” in a poem dedicated to him. See Pryer, “Approaching Monteverdi,” 17.'>103</a></sup>
        Drawing from experience of both the mythological aesthetic of Rudolf II’s impressive art collection in Prague—in
        particular the Mannerist works of Bartholomäus Spranger (1546–1611), Hans von Aachen (1552–1615), and Adriaen de
        Vries (1545–1626)—and then the alchemical masques at the court of James I in London, where he surely discovered
        many of the fugues that were to grace the <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Maier was ideally suited for a project
        designed to appeal on a multitude of levels to a cultured, educated courtly audience.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On Spranger, see Metzler, 129–48. On the fine arts and Prague mannerism, see Evans, ch. 5, “Rudolf and the Fine Arts,” and ch. 7, “Prague Mannerism and the Magic Universe.” On Ben Jonson and alchemy, see Linden, ch. 5, “‘Abstract riddles of our stone’: Ben Jonson and the Drama of Alchemy.” <a href="/essays/ludwig"
          target="_blank">Loren Ludwig</a> has discovered that Maier took 40 of his fugues from <em>Divers & Sundry Waies of Two Parts in One, to the Number of Fortie upon one Playnsong</em> (1591), a collection by a composer of the English madrigal school, John Farmer.'>104</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier continued to display an interest in the relations between mythology and alchemy in almost all of his
        subsequent publications. Sometimes this interest manifests as an imaginative alchemical interpretation of pagan
        myth, sometimes as the importation of mythological discourse in order to make alchemical symbolism more
        accessible (and more palatable) to a humanist-trained readership. As a Rosicrucian apologist, Maier must have
        been aware of the low status of gold-making alchemy in the eyes of the authors of the manifestos and, as
        mentioned above, familiar with their condemnations of chymical works that transgress the boundaries of religion.
        Maier’s own criticism of authors who draw parallels between the passion of Christ and the preparation of the
        Stone doubtless reflects this sentiment, and perhaps his focus on pagan mythology serves as a deflection from
        alchemy being identified as blasphemy and an assertion of its cultural relevance. As Didier Kahn states, rooting
        alchemy in mythology is also a particularly useful strategy for extending knowledge of alchemy far back into the
        past, as something that predated classical authorities like Aristotle and Galen, thereby emphasizing its
        hoariness, its venerability.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Kahn, <em>Alchimie et Paracelsisme</em>, 66–67.'>105</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would disagree with H. J. Sheppard’s claim that the time of Maier’s publications, when “alchemy produced its
        finest examples of pictorial symbolism,” necessarily coincided with “the negation of the material properties of
        alchemy” and “removed alchemy from the hands of the goldmaker.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 52.'>106</a></sup> As Hereward Tilton points out,
        gold-making may not have been the main goal of Maier’s practice, which was more concerned with the use of gold
        as <em>aurum potabile</em> [drinkable gold] in chemical medicine, but it was nevertheless part of his training
        and repertoire; indeed, many of the quotes in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> have their sources in medieval
        <em>chrysopoetic</em> literature.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 97.'>107</a></sup> Likewise, the rather
        simplistic tendency to relegate visual forms of alchemy to a form of “spiritual quest” should also be
        reconsidered.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sheppard, “Mythological Tradition,” 52. John Read (<em>Through Alchemy to Chemistry</em>, 87) and Frances Yates (<em>Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>, 82) are two other, older sources guilty of such preconceptions.'>108</a></sup>
        The multiple levels of exegesis (Chymical, Physical, Arithmetical, Musical, Geometrical, and Astronomical)
        suggested by Maier in his discussion of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem
            1</a></span> avoid any suggestion that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> or its mytho-chymical content should be
        construed as a “spiritual” work. What they do, instead, is insert chymical knowledge at the head of a list of
        predominantly liberal arts, an emphatic assertion of its intellectual worth. Given the variable and contesting
        interpretations of alchemical texts, terms, and images in general, it should not be expected that there was ever
        any agreement on alchemical interpretations of myth. Mythology was coopted to support alchemists’ individual
        theories, be they <em>chrysopoetic, chymiatric, or phlogistic</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 175, with reference to Du Bosquet’s <em>Concordance mytho-physico-cabalo-ermétique</em>.'>109</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries certainly saw the publication of numerous works whose titles contain
        references to mythical figures; some, like Pierre-Jean Fabre’s <em>Hercules Piochymicus</em> (Devoutly Chymical
        Hercules, 1634), claimed to reveal alchemical and Christian secrets in Hercules’ Labors, while Ehrd von
        Naxagoras’ (i.e., Johann Erhard Neithold) <em>Aureum vellus</em> (Golden Fleece, 1733) discusses various
        renditions of the tale of the Golden Fleece.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='A shorter version of the <em>Aureum vellus</em> (1715) exists, but lacks this material.'>110</a></sup>
        Many, however, display no interest in mythoalchemical reflection or speculation, as, for instance, David de
        Planis Campy’s <em>L’Hydre morbifique exterminée par l’Hercule chimique</em> (The Morbific Hydra Exterminated by
        the Chymical Hercules, 1628); Johann Baptista Grosschedel’s <em>Proteus Mercurialis geminus</em> (Twofold
        Mercurial Proteus, 1629); Christoph Reibehand’s <em>Filum Ariadnes</em> (Ariadne’s Thread, 1639); Johannes
        Baptista Marengus’ <em>Palladis chymicae arcana detecta</em> (The Secrets of Chymical Pallas Revealed, 1678), or
        Johann Joachim Becher’s <em>Oedipus chymicus</em> (Chymical Oedipus, 1680).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Telle, “Mythologie und Alchemie,” 13.'>111</a></sup> The best-known author undeniably
        indebted to Maier must be Dom Antoine-Joseph Pernety (1716–1796), who plagiarized <em>Arcana arcanissima</em> in his
          <em>Fables égyptiennes et grecques dévoilées</em> (Egyptian and Greek Fables Unveiled, 1758).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Kahn, “Alchemical Interpretations,” 171.'>112</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Maier complains about the expenses he incurred in his publications, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        apparently enjoyed some success, for it was reprinted in 1618, and reappeared in modified form, without the
        fugues, later in the century as the <em>Scrutinium chymicum</em> (Chymical Investigation) in 1687.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“While he was paid twenty-one <em>Batzen</em> per sheet by his distributors, his own costs for the production of his Emblemata (probably the <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 1618) already came to twenty-five <em>Batzen</em> per sheet [1 Reichsthaler = 23 Batzen].” Lenke et al, 18.'>113</a></sup>
        His highly creative combination of alchemy, music, and myth continues to inspire artists, musicians,
        psychotherapists, and at least some historians to this day.
