        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is a curious work. On the surface, it is a retooling of the story from Ovid’s
        <em>Metamorphoses</em> about a legendary race between a beautiful huntress named Atalanta and her suitor
        Hippomenes, who won their contest with the help of three golden apples that he received from the goddess of
        love, Venus.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

          and to the restoration of the mind, by means of more or less 50 Musical Flights for three Voices, of which two
          should respond to one plain melody suitable for singing the couplets, not without [each other]; to be seen,
          read, reflected upon, understood, judged, sung and heard with singular pleasure.<sup><a href="#"

        This is followed by the official designations of the author, Michael Maier (“Count of the Imperial Consistory,
        Doctor of Medicine, Knight Exemplus, Etc.”), as well as the book’s publication information (“Oppenheim from the
        press of Hieronymus Gallerus, at the expense of Johann Theodor de Bry, 1618”).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Imperial. Consistorii Comite, Med. D. Eq. ex. Etc”; “Oppenheimii Ex typographia Hieronymi Galleri, Sumptibus Joh. Theodori de Bry.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [1].'>3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is actually a fusion of three different subject areas—secular vocal music,
        emblematics, and alchemy—showcased in a tour de force of <a href="/front-matter/getacquainted/printing/" target="_blank">early modern print technologies</a>. Essentially, Maier’s “new chymical emblems about the secrets of nature” are multimedia
        units of information formatted as three interlocking pieces: fugue, emblem, and discourse.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Newman and Principe, “Alchemy vs. Chemistry,” for usage of the term “chymistry” in early modern alchemical literature.'>4</a></sup>
        There are fifty emblems to engage the reader’s “eyes and intellect,” paired with fifty musical fugues
        (“flights”) that engage the ears. Each fugue-emblem set is completed by a two-page discourse (“notes”) that
        provides context and relevant bibliographic information. Various vignettes frame the title’s text, depicting
        scenes from Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> where Venus tells her lover Adonis about Atalanta’s story. With its
        interplay of text and image, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ title page is a rich and immersive summary of the book. <a href="/essays/nummedal/" target="_blank">Tara
        Nummedal</a> presents an elegant anatomy of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> in this volume, examining how the reader’s
        sensory experience of Maier’s musical alchemical emblem book functions as a tool to engage with its various
        allegorical layers in order to reach the inner alchemical meanings it embodies. Yet <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> deviates from early modern emblem book norms,
        most obviously with Maier’s full-scale integration of music. This is atypical of the genre.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For early modern emblem book culture, see Daly and Manning, <em>Renaissance and Baroque Symbol Theory</em>; and Adams and Linden, <em>Emblems and Alchemy</em>.'>5</a></sup>
        While emblem books from the Low Countries containing musical elements exist, such inclusions are sporadic and
        unsystematic.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Raasveld, <em>Emblem Books</em>, for a group of emblem books from the Low Countries where authors have made part of their emblems singable or have added a singable text.'>6</a></sup>
        In contrast, the vocal scores in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> are purposive. They follow the emblem’s tripartite
        motto-image-epigram structure, but where an image would conventionally be inserted between the textual elements,
        Maier fits a musical score for three voices: “Atalanta fleeing” [<em>Atalanta fugiens</em>], “Hippomenes following”
        [<em>Hippomenes sequens</em>], and the “Delaying Apple” [<em>Pomum morans</em>]. Maier in effect creates a sonic
        emblem that mirrors its visual counterpart, presented in a double-page layout with text set in two languages
        (German and Latin) in two different type styles, their contrasting fonts lending the musical emblems an elegant
        aesthetic (<strong>fig. 1</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier mentions money he lost with his “Emblemata” in correspondence from 1622; see Lenke et al., “Nine Newly Discovered Letters,” 30–31.'>7</a></sup>

      <p>
        But why did Maier create a musical alchemical emblem book? This essay proposes the following imaginative reading of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> based on a modern scholarly interpretation of seventeenth-century ludic culture: that Maier engineered his musical alchemical emblem book to both conceal and reveal two books in one, creating a virtuoso work of steganography whereby a magic square is hidden in plain sight. Steganography is a
        form of secret writing that conceals a message or information in a cover text. A magic square is the term for a
        mathematical puzzle that is comprised of a square grid of numbered cells whose rows, columns, and diagonals all
        add up to the same value. I argue that Maier plays with the inherent duality that defines the emblem itself—the
        allegorical art of concealing and revealing information—to create a book that can be read as fifty sequential
        musical emblems, or reshuffled as a magic square. Reading <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a mathematical puzzle
        becomes a conceptual exercise in the creation of new combinations of “chymical emblems” and “musical flights”
        for exploring the secrets of nature, a leitmotif highlighted in Maier’s title, the Preface to the Reader
        [<em>Praefatio ad lectorem</em>], and in the header for each of the fifty emblems, “About the Secrets of Nature”
        [<em>De secretis naturae</em>]. From the standpoint of the steganography hypothesis, I posit that the shift from
        the book’s visible version to a hidden puzzle is predicated upon the reader’s detecting and then solving clues
        that Maier has embedded in the design of the emblems. In chasing Atalanta, the reader becomes a hunter and
        collector of clues that Maier has dispersed throughout the emblems. In sorting out and evaluating these clues,
        interpretation and contemplation turn into an interactive game based on the transmutation of the number of
        emblems from fifty to forty-nine that occurs with uncovering the magic square.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Newman and Principe discuss dispersion of information and the reader’s obligation to hunt down clues in alchemical texts (<em>Alchemy Tried in the Fire</em>, 186–87). See Eamon, “Science as a Hunt”; and Cook, Smith, and Meyers, “Making and Knowing,” on the hunt for knowledge as a dangerous and risky enterprise.'>8</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, Emblems <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">1</a></span>, <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">2</a></span>, and <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="26">26</a></span> are understood to contain clues in their textual elements that are split
        up and then rejoined through recognition of their literary source, providing the reader with keys to discovering
        the hidden puzzle, i.e., the magic square.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> for identification and analysis of Maier’s literary sources in the emblems and discourses.'>9</a></sup>
        These three emblems are also interconnected by a reference in <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> title that can be
        interpreted to indicate a shift in the total number of musical emblems from fifty to forty-nine, which is
        integral to the magic square-encipherment hypothesis. The title provides a detailed outline of the fifty musical
        fugues in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, a number that is borne out by the book’s contents. Yet at the same time,
        Maier seems to equivocate about this total, using the phrase “more or less” [<em>plus minus</em>] as part of his
        enumeration. Why? The following examination of the beginning, middle, and end points of <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> postulates the hidden presence of a magic square as a possible explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This essay considers <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a steganographic work from the following angles: 1) through
        the identification of binaries that I refer to as “doubling,” which facilitates exploration of a trope that
        Maier uses in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to express notions of transformation from one thing/state into another,
        and to signal clues in halved textual elements whose hidden meaning emerges when they are rejoined; and 2) as a
        structural examination of how doubling works in the design of Emblems <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="1">1</a></span>, <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">2</a></span>,
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="26">26</a></span>, and <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="50">50</a></span>, whose assessment from this standpoint demonstrates
        how we can think about Maier’s emblems in terms of cover text and ciphertext.

        Think of an emblem that you see on a printed page (its whole motto-image-epigram package) as akin to the outer
        shell of a nut, which encases its kernel. Similarly, an emblem’s message is encased in its outer form (i.e., its
        textual and graphic representation upon the page), and the reader apprehends its hidden inner message through
        contemplation of the interplay between word and image, essentially peeling away this allegorical wrapper to
        reach the innermost kernel of meaning. Contemplation awakens insight from which knowledge takes root and grows.
        Thus, an emblem both conceals and reveals its inner meaning to the reader, whose ability to apprehend it also
        lies in recognizing the literary allusions that the author has used in its construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier plays with this mode of concealing and revealing information through doubling, which functions as a
        flexible allegorical conceit in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Doubling, as used here, refers to Maier’s
        simultaneous communication of both the inner and outer natures of a thing or idea. Doubling aligns with other
        early modern techniques of concealment such as dispersion, <em>Decknamen</em>, syncope, and parathesis, employed
        in alchemical texts and images to protect secret knowledge from ignorant or unworthy eyes.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Newman and Principe, <em>Alchemy Tried in the Fire</em>, 186–88. Dispersion is the scattering of information across texts; Decknamen are cover names; syncope abbreviates an alchemical process and can omit information; parathesis involves needless multiplication of ingredients or processes. See also Rampling, “Secret Language,” 38–45.'>10</a></sup>
        Furthermore, doubling in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> riffs on the idea of transformation that structures the book
        itself. The reader in fact encounters doubling in the very first page of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, which is a
        single leaf imprinted with the title page on one side, and the Author’s Epigram [<em>Epigramma authoris</em>] on
        the other. Here, the materiality of the book functions as a dual-sided delivery system of information that
        communicates both depictions and descriptions of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> alchemical interface with Ovid’s
        Atalanta story. The following examination of the relationship between Maier’s title page and the Author’s
        Epigram provides a useful template for identifying and explicating the hermeneutics of doubling in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin with, there are essentially two tandem versions of the Atalanta story. Ovid’s tale lends the framework
        for Maier’s alchemical adaptation, with themes around the transformation of states and natures serving as
        connective tissue between the two authors.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='As <a href="/essays/ludwig"
          target="_blank">Loren Ludwig</a> discusses, there are also two composers in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: John Farmer, and another unidentified composer—likely Maier.'>11</a></sup>
        In <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, the characters of Atalanta and Hippomenes represent two of the three principal
        alchemical elements, mercury and sulfur, and in the context of this personification perhaps Maier implies that
        the golden apple is the third element, salt.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For an overview of the Paracelsian <em>tria prima</em> (mercury, sulfur, and salt), see Moran, “Survey of Chemical Medicine,” 121–33.'>12</a></sup>
        The title page (<strong>fig. 2</strong>) illustrates specific episodes of their story, which Maier highlights in the “Author’s Epigram,”
        and both title and epigram draw attention to the union and transformation of Atalanta/mercury and
        Hippomenes/sulfur. The lovers’ profane embrace in Cybele’s temple is captured in the bottom right-hand vignette
        of the title page, their subsequent transformation into lions embodied in the illustration of the two beasts
        that pace between the temple scene and the race. The “Author’s Epigram” elaborates on this, describing Atalanta
        and Hippomenes’ change of state as a “re-clothing” into lion skins, an action that makes their bodies become
        red, and an allusion to the perfection of alchemical matter.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        With Maier's literary shift away from an Ovidian referent, the two lovers’ copulation in Cybele’s temple morphs

        The concluding verse of the Author’s Epigram marks the medical arts as fundamental to Maier’s alchemical
        program: “Whatever the world [holds] of wealth, or Medicine holds of health, / the double Lion is able to supply
        all in abundance.” The “double lion” adds yet another layer of meaning to the
        Atalanta/mercury Hippomenes/sulfur transformation trope. Their alchemical union will produce the philosophers’
        stone, the means to attain wealth and health, and a subtle irenic subtext can be discerned in Maier’s intimation
        of the riches that transmutational alchemy provides the worthy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Principe, “Practical Science.”'>15</a></sup> Thus, the Garden of the Hesperides, our
        entrance into <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, becomes a metonym for the Garden of Eden where the expulsion of Adam
        and Eve elides with the punishment of Atalanta and Hippomenes. The golden apple links the Tree of Life in
        Genesis 2:9 and 3:22–24 to the alchemical elixir of life given biblical testimony in Revelation 22:1–2, wherein
        its curative properties, fed by the crystal clear waters of the river that flows from the throne of God, are an
        archetype for Eden restored.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Maier’s reference to wealth and health in the Author’s Epigram receives full articulation in
        Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26, the emblem dedicated to those who seek Wisdom (<strong>fig. 3</strong>).

        “someone” who approaches her “with reason and hand” [<em>ratione manúque</em>], the bodily instruments of

        entry into the Rose Garden of wisdom, handicapped, having no feet to support him and without the use of his
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Atalanta and Hippomenes as <em>Decknamen</em> for mercury and sulfur, Maier’s musical emblem book scripts a
        rich exploration into the investigation of the secrets of nature through alchemy, understood by contemporaries
        as the art of material separations and transformations by fire. Early modern alchemy had medico-pharmaceutical
        and industrial applications.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Debus, <em>Chemical Philosophy</em>, and Principe, <em>Secrets of Alchemy</em>, esp. 81. Newman and Principe discuss industrial products “under the dominion of chymistry” in mining and metallurgy, brewing, dyeing, perfume-, soap-, and pigment-making (<em>George Starkey</em>, ix). See Dupré, <em>Laboratories of Art</em>, for discussion about alchemy in artisanal practices.'>19</a></sup>
        It was also a system of investigation that explored nature’s secrets through chymical processes of
        transmutation, often centered around <em>chrysopoea</em> (gold-making), a mode of alchemical practice lauded
        (often by the alchemist him- or herself) as a noble and divinely sanctioned endeavor.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Smith, <em>Body of the Artisan</em>; Bilak, “Alchemy and the End Times”; Parshall, Walton, and Moran, <em>Bridging Traditions</em>; Nummedal, <em>Lion’s Blood</em>.'>20</a></sup>
        Philosophical gold was believed achievable through the successful completion of a series of chymical processes
        involving separation of pure and impure parts in the perfection of matter. This would ultimately produce the
        universal cure to eradicate human disease and prolong life, affecting a return to prelapsarian perfection. The
        “true” alchemist held to this altruism in order that he or she be judged apart from the base desire for material
        gain that was the hallmark of the charlatan.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, could <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> be designed around a network of clues that conceals a mathematical puzzle?
        Maier himself draws attention to the existence of “secret signs” [<em>arcanas . . . notas</em>] in the Author’s
        Epigram, which goes on to state: “I bear these offerings [i.e., the emblems] to the senses, so that the
        intellect, through these enticements, might seize the precious things that lie hidden.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Auribus ista tuis, oculisque Emblemata prostent, / At ratio arcanas expetat inde notas . . . ” And penultimate verse: “Sensibus haec objecta tuli, intellectus ut illis / Illicibus caperet, quae preciosa latent.” Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> [2].'>21</a></sup>
        The following case study examines points of connectivity among Emblems <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"

        The reader who is familiar with core alchemical texts will immediately recognize something familiar about the
        mottos in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a
            href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span>, respectively: “the wind carried him in
        his belly” and “his nurse is the earth.” These mottos in fact together form the second part of a precept from
        the <em>Tabula smaragdina</em> (Emerald Tablet), held to be authored by Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient Egyptian
        magus-king-philosopher: “Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon. The wind carried it in its belly, the
        Earth is its nurse.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> de Jong provides both an English translation and the original Latin text (59 n7), identifies the printed source as <em>Theatrum Chemicum</em>, 1, 362 (57), and discusses the textual connection between the mottos in Emblems 1 and 2 (65).'>27</a></sup>
        Significantly, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> commences with reference to a text considered by Maier and his
        contemporaries as one of the most venerable authorities on the secrets of transmutation in the alchemical
        corpus.
      </p>
      <p><span>
          Based on the textual connection between these two mottos, <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
              data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem
              2</a></span> combine to form a dual-sided introduction to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Their conflation
          constitutes a kind of doubling whereby two things, or texts, or concepts, merge into a single entity, just as
          a coin is a single object with two distinct faces. The conflation of texts in the mottos of <span><a
              href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a href="#"
              class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span> relates to the dual-sided doubling embodied in
          the single leaf that bears the title page on its front and the Author’s Epigram on its back. We also see this
          in Maier’s reference to the double lion in the Author’s Epigram, where, significantly, Maier does not use the
          Latin plural form of lion in his allegorization of the union of Atalanta/mercury and Hippomenes/sulfur, even
          though a male and a female lion are depicted as two entities in the title page. Maier’s pointed reference to
          “the double lion” as <em>Leo geminus</em> intends for the reader to understand this alchemical transformation
          as producing a new state of matter from the combination of two different qualities. The mottos in
          <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a href="#"
              class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span> similarly reflect the combination of two things
          into one entity. This notion of doubling in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
              data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
              data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span> is also reinforced by the Latin grammar of the mottos themselves, which in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> is in the perfect
          indicative (a tense that provides the “back story,” if you will), while the motto in <span><a href="#"
              class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span> is given in the present indicative. In this
          way, they also express two states of time: past and present. Notably, the motto in <a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="3">Emblem 3</a></span> signals a change in tone, using the imperative to
        express command.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        noun in both Hebrew and Latin throughout Proverbs. She is attired in a Minerva-esque muscle cuirass and a
        three-pointed crown, and she stands in the middle of a pathway in between beams of celestial light and a tree.
        The banderole in her right (upturned) hand connects to this empyrean light, while the one in her left

        Maier features musical doubling in Fugue 26 (<strong>fig. 6</strong>). The interval of imitation of the two canonic voices (Atalanta and
        Hippomenes) in Fugue 26 is the double octave, stated as such in its header with the reference “8 duplici.” Fugue
        26 is among the nine unison or octave canons in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and Maier gives the same instructions
        in Fugue 47 (also a double octave).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='There are total of nine canons at the unison, octave, or double octave in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: Fugues 8, 14, 26, 27, 34, 37, 45, 46, and 47.'>32</a></sup>
        After the unison, the octave is the most perfect consonance, and two octaves is the greatest interval of
        imitation between the canonic voices of Atalanta and Hippomenes in the book. In Fugue 26, Atalanta is a high
        soprano while Hippomenes is scored as a bass, and the Delaying Apple is a tenor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The header for Fugue 26 contains some unusual elements. It reads in its entirely: “<em>gFUGA XXII. in 8.
          duplici; infrà</em>” [gFugue 22, 2 octaves below]. As such, it has two typographical infelicities: the letter
        “g” that is attached to the word “FUGA,” and the inaccurate Roman numeral that should read XXVI instead of XXII.
        The extra “g” might relate to the fact that Fugue 26 is based on Farmer’s canon 7.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='See <a href="/essays/ludwig"
          target="_blank">Ludwig</a> on Maier’s adaptation of Farmer’s music.'>33</a></sup> Maier
        transposes the whole piece up a fourth (this is true for all of Farmer’s music in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>),
        hence the Apple melody starts on D and ends on G. Moreover, “g” is the seventh letter in the alphabet, and its
        placement in the header might be a conceit on Maier’s part in reference to the original musical source.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See <a href="/essays/ludwig/#maiers" target="_blank">Ludwig</a> on the interpretation of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="6">Emblem 6</a></span> as a possible tacit acknowledgment of John Farmer as Maier’s musical source.'>34</a></sup>
        The erroneous Roman numeral in Fugue 26 is puzzling, yet it is not the only typographical error in
        Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26. There is another typo in the header on page 115 (i.e., the second of the two-page
        Discourse 26), which reads “YXVI” (which is not a valid Roman numeral) instead of “XXVI.” Misnumbering in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is not in and of itself unusual; printers can make mistakes.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Header errors in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> occur on 40, Fugue VIII, an octave canon, header reads “FUGA IV [etc.]”; 68, Fugue XV, header for the German translation of the Latin epigram labeled “XI” instead of “XV”; 112, Fugue XXVI header reads “gFUGA XXII [etc.]”; 115, Discourse XXVI header with Roman numeral “YXVI”; and 185, Emblem XLIV header with Roman numeral “LXIV.” There are numerous pagination errors throughout the book.'>35</a></sup>
        However, it is noteworthy that 26 contains more misprints in its headers than any other musical emblem in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and it is the only instance in the book where the header of a fugue contains an extra
        letter as well as an incorrect Roman numeral.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intentional or otherwise, the typos in the headers of Fugue-Emblem-Discourse 26 draw attention, as does its
        overall emphasis on wisdom, communicated through numerous scriptural references that structure this emblem. The
        source of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="26">Emblem 26’s</a></span> motto is Proverbs
        3:18, while Maier’s reference therein to the “Wood of life” signposts the centrality of medicine in this
        emblem.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.” Proverbs 3:18 (King James Version). <em>Lignum vitae</em> (i.e., guaiacum) is the name for a hardwood species known in the early modern period for its medicinal virtue. For discussion of its medical use and the representation of guaiacum on <em>Nova Reperta</em>’s title page, see Smith, “Art, Science and Visual Culture.”'>36</a></sup>
        Maier’s <em>lignum vitae</em> in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="26">Emblem 26</a></span>
        is the counterpart to the <em>arbor vitae</em>, the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, which bears fruit that
        gives eternal life.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.” Genesis 2:9 (King James Version).'>37</a></sup>
        The motif of wealth and health introduced in the Author’s Epigram is thus linked to Epigram 26 by its references
        to Proverbs 3:16 and 18, verses that declare the blessedness of those who seek Wisdom, and the honor and riches
        that are bestowed upon those who find her. Discourse 26 features additional scriptural citations in both its
        text and marginalia related to the theme of wisdom.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sirach 4:13; Sapientia 8:16; Sir. 4:20; Sap. 10:10; Proverbs 3:18; Lactantius Book 3:13; Prov. 3:35; Sir. 1:24; Sir. 4:12, 14; Sap. 6:21; Sap. 8:13; Sap. 10:12; Ecclesiastes 7:20; Baruch 3:14; Sap. 8:5, 18; Sap. 7:11; Sir. 1:24. Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 114–15. <em>Atalanta running</em>, 84 contains two errors in the marginalia: the Lactantius entry reads “Lac. b.9.13,” and the last Biblical citation (Sirach) reads “Sir. 1.v.25.” For identification of Lactantius, see de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 197 and 199.'>38</a></sup>
        Here, Maier asserts that Wisdom is the embodiment of “the true knowledge of Chymistry together with practice,”
        and that all good things come from the labor of her hands.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . nor in any thing else, but the true knowledge of Chymistry together with practice, most com[m]odious to mankind.” <em>Atalanta running</em>, 84. “ . . . nisi veram Chymię cognitionem, cum praxi, humano generi utilissima, conjunctam.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 114.'>39</a></sup>
        Alchemical praxis brings spiritual and earthly reward. Discourse 26 concludes by saying that the Tree of Life
        shows the way to eternal life while bearing wholesome fruit to be used in the temporal world, for without wealth
        and health, “a man even living is dead.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The emblem that draws <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to a close appropriately relates to tincture, the final
        alchemical stage in producing the philosophers’ stone. This is signaled in the concluding verse of <span><a
            href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="50">Emblem 50's</a></span> epigram: “Hence his body is given to
        death and is tinged with gore: This is the true path of your work.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Tincture is the culmination of the alchemist’s work, it embodies the idea of imbuing or permeating purified
        matter with color. The motto’s source is a passage from <em>Turba philosophorum</em> (Crowd of Philosophers)
        that describes the union of opposites by the binding of the dragon with a woman put to death for killing her
        husbands; her intestines are full of poison, which is a substance of transformation.<sup><a href="#"

            data-text-content='De Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 312–13; de Jong, 58, excerpt from <em>Turba philosophorum</em> in <em>Auriferae artis</em> vol. 1; de Jong, 340–41, discussion of various editions of Turba philosophorum.'>44</a></sup>
        The <em>Turba philosophorum</em> goes on to describe how, in the grave, the dragon’s body mixes with the woman’s
        and gradually turns to blood, which the philosophers desiccate in the sun: “Then the poison appears, and what is
        hidden takes shape.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Et tunc apparet venenum, et occultum manifestatur.” De Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta fugiens,”</em> 312–13.'>45</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="50">Emblem 50</a></span>, doubling is used to express
        the binding and the union of opposites, depicted in the emblem’s image by the woman lying bound in the coils of
        a dragon where they look to be on the brink of a kiss, an intimate commingling of two bodies. Maier concludes
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> with a sentence in Discourse 50 that adjures the “Sons of learning” to understand the
        meaning of the woman and the dragon, which Maier says he has revealed perhaps too openly, to share in these
        revelations about “the secrets of almost the whole art” undertaken for the glory of God.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Maier refers to the woman as “the eagle” in this discourse: “Aquila itaque & mulier, nec non draco ac totius ferè artis arcana hoc percepto, intelliguntur, quae fortè nimis aperto naturae gremio hactenus doctrinae filiis exposuimus & declaravimus, ut hinc DEO SIT GLORIA.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 211.'>46</a></sup>
        With this final emblem, the conceit of doubling brings full circle the themes of birth, death, and renewal.

        Handwritten codes and ciphers were a common feature of official and private correspondence even as printed

        Steganography conceals a message in plain sight, which can be done in diverse ways: from using a grille overlaid
        atop a text, to using alphabet letters as in Francis Bacon’s biliteral cipher.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Maier used emblems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cipher can be created using a variety of systems: words, numbers, sound, and gesture, among other things. From
        this perspective, Maier’s fragmentation of texts in Emblems <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="1">1</a></span>, <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">2</a></span>, and
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="26">26</a></span> is thought provoking. Are there causal
        factors associated with this physical division of the mottos in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="2">Emblem 2</a></span>?
        The conflation of these two mottos into one unit of information connotes a numerical shift in the total number
        of musical emblems from fifty to forty-nine, which would invest a deeper meaning to Maier’s “more or less”
        [<em>plus minus</em>] reference in the title. Loren Ludwig has established that Maier did not in fact compose
        forty of the fifty fugues, but used a compilation of forty choral exercises from <em>Divers & Sundry Waies of Two Parts in One, to the Number of Fortie upon one Playnsong</em> (1591) by the English composer John Farmer. On the one hand, Fugues 42 and 43 are both
        taken from Farmer’s canon 19, which provides two options for the way the parts can be ordered. Thus, Maier’s
        <em>plus minus</em> reference may just be signaling that two of the fugues are really the same fugue. On the
        other hand, this does not address why Maier came up with additional fugues to total fifty musical
        emblems.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Ludwig identifies Farmer as the source for forty of the fugues, but it is not known who composed the other ten—although it is likely to have been Maier.'>51</a></sup>
        Why not just stick to the forty canons from <em>Sundry Waies</em>? Maier’s ambiguous <em>plus minus</em> phrase
        in <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> title may or may not indicate a shift in the total number of musical fugues.
        Arguably, the conflation of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span> and

          But what is the point of this? Wisdom may provide the key: in both cases Emblem 26/25 retains its place in
          the overall order as the central emblem. Since this leaves a sequence of 49 = 7 x 7 emblems, <em>Atalanta
            fugiens</em> can be rearranged into a 7 x 7 magic square, for which Maier may have turned to Heinrich
          Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim’s <em>De occulta philosophia</em> (On Hidden Philosophy, 1533) as a
          source.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        There is compelling evidence within <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> for positing an association with Agrippa von
        Nettesheim’s 7 x 7 Venus magic square. The goddess Venus is a significant character in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>. She asserts a prominent visual presence in Maier’s title page while her voice is implied therein
        as the narrator of the Atalanta story. Maier’s Preface to the Reader tangibly connects Venus to the physical
        book through his reference to the most abstruse chymical secrets that are engraved in Venus or copper, an
        allusion to copper as Venus’ metallic element as well as to the material used to produce the emblems’
        etchings.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Veneri sive cupro . . . incisa, Chymica secretissima . . .” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 8. Maier also references “figures cut in copper” [<em>figuris cupro incisis</em>] in the title. This however is not exclusive to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>: the expression "figuris cupro incisis" is also found in the title page of Maier’s <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em>.'>56</a></sup>
        Transformation is more than a theme in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>; it is embedded in the DNA of the book itself.
        From this perspective, with the emblems’ transmutation of numbers from fifty to forty-nine, the book morphs into
        a magic square associated with Venus, who is also the consort of Vulcan, god of forge and of the alchemist’s
        tool of transformation: fire.

        By definition, a magic square is an <em>n</em> x <em>n</em> array of numbers (from 1 to <em>n</em><sup style="font-weight: 400;">2</sup>)
        whose rows, columns, and two diagonals sum to the magic number <em>μ</em>, defined as
        <em>n</em>(<em>n</em><sup style="font-weight: 400;">2</sup> + 1) / 2.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        In a 7 x 7 magic square, the numbers 1 through 49 must be ordered in such a way that every row, column, and
        diagonal sums up to the magic number 175.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The equation for this is 7(7<sup style="font-weight: 400;">2</sup> + 1) / 2 = 175.'>58</a></sup> The number of

        However, the focus here is on the 7 x 7 Venus magic square from Agrippa von Nettesheim, which has 25 at its
        center.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Hereafter, the hypothetical puzzle in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> based on Agrippa von Nettesheim’s published table is referred to as the Venus magic square.'>60</a></sup>
        The center number is a defining property of the magic square and it is always found by dividing its magic number
        (which in a 7 x 7 magic square is 175) by its dimension (in this case 7), which here calculates to 25. Any 7 x 7
        array that satisfies these conditions qualifies as a magic square.

            In this regular magic square, any two rows (or columns) that are equidistant from the center row (or column)
            can be exchanged, and the magic square will still be magic. Exchanging two columns does not change the sum
            total of any of the columns, because this exchange does not change any of the numbers. This exchange also
            does not change the sum total of any of the rows because it only changes the order of the numbers but not
            the numbers themselves. This exchange also does not change the sum total of the diagonals. Such an exchange
            swaps two cells along each diagonal; however, due to the regularity of the square, the sum of any two such
            cells is 50, and thus swapping them does not change the total sum. Note: for a general magic square, if you
            exchanged such rows equidistant from the center row and also the corresponding columns, you would preserve
            the magic squareness property. What is stated here about the Venus magic square is that its regularity
            transfers a stronger kind of symmetry.

      <p>The Venus magic square has an extra property in part because it has 25 in its center, and because of
        regularity, it is a mathematical necessity that wisdom (26/25) be in the center of Maier’s puzzle. It is an
        open mathematical question as to whether or not the Venus magic square is unique given that the number of unique
        regular 7 x 7 magic squares is unknown. However, if Maier did in fact purpose-build <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        around a hidden 7 x 7 magic square, having a total number of forty musical emblems as per Farmer would not work.
        As a magic square, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> presents a delightful inversion of encipherment, as its visible
        sequence of 1–50 musical emblems actually constitutes the scrambled text for the concealed mathematical puzzle,
        which reorders them according to the algorithm of the magic square, and through its rotations. In this way,
        Maier hides the Venus magic square in plain sight.</p>

      <p>Magic squares are recreational, playful, and creative. If <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is a game, how do we play it?
      Perhaps figuring this out is part of the hunt for “secret signs” that Maier alludes to in the Author’s Epigram.</p>      
      <p>If we reorder <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> into the Venus magic square as per Agrippa von Nettesheim, then Emblems

Read vertically, these emblems retain their position
        in the Venus magic square as the beginning, middle, and end of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.<sup><a href="#"

      <p>The motto in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="17">Emblem 17</a></span> reads, “The
        fourfold circuit rules this work of fire,” and its epigram assigns the four fiery spheres depicted in the image
        to Vulcan, Mercury, Luna, and Apollo.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Orbita quadruplex hoc regit ignis opus.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 77.'>63</a></sup>
        The motto in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="42">Emblem 42</a></span> lists four
        requirements for chymical investigation: Nature as a guide, together with reason, experiment, and
        reading.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content=' “In Chymicis versanti Natura, Ratio, Experientia & lectio, sint Dux, scipio, perspicilia & lampas.” [For the one considering Chymical things, let Nature, Reason, Experiment & reading be the Leader, staff, spectacles & lamp.] Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 177.'>64</a></sup>
        In Discourse 42, Maier relates these four attributes to the four wheels of the Philosophic chariot.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Hisce enim, tanquam quatuor rotis currus Philosophicus incedit . . . ” [For by these, as by four wheels, the Philosophic chariot move . . .] Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 178. '>65</a></sup>
        From this perspective, we can extrapolate a connection between the four fiery spheres in <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="17">Emblem 17</a></span> and the four-wheeled chariot in <span><a
            href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="42">Emblem 42</a></span> based on their intertextuality. The
        example of such a plausible pairing between Emblems 17/16 and 42/41 also demonstrates how information that is
        dispersed in the 1–50 emblem sequence of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> can be reconstituted in emblems’
        reconfiguration in the Venus magic square.</p>
      <p>Another hypothetical grouping is discernible along the third row of the Venus magic square, that is: Emblems 31/30, 7/6, 25/24, and 50/49. These four emblems can be read
        from left to right or right to left, based on reduplicated features between them, such as the swimming person in Emblems 31 and 25, the mountain in Emblems 7 and 25, and the dragon in Emblems 25 and 50.</p>

        What other kinds of new pairings can be created in following the Venus magic square’s algorithm? Do pairings

        Pathways run through the 1–50 sequence of emblems in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Maier’s alchemical path to

        lifts his billowy right hand to reveal the point of entry: a ruined castle gateway composed of the remains of

        In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="26">Emblem 26</a></span>, Wisdom stands in the middle
        of a path, in the middle of the book, as the fulcrum between its visible and hidden versions. The path ends in

        All fifty emblems interconnect to communicate a storyline around the creation of the philosophers’ stone, the
        panacea that was the goal of transmutational alchemy. Yet Maier’s allegorical exposition of alchemical arts does
        not unfold procedurally. This storyline is broken up with pieces scattered across <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.
        Connectivity emerges through the reoccurrence of specific objects in certain emblems and through identification
        of alchemical processes, signposted in the emblems by depictions of material things and activities. For example,
        in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="6">Emblem 6</a></span> a husbandman [<em>ruricola</em>]
        scatters gold coins like a shower of seeds from a bowl he cradles in one arm; similar gold coins appear in
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="18">Emblem 18</a></span> piled in a large two-handled bowl
        before a roaring furnace tended by a craftsman.

        One man consistently appears throughout the book, a kind of main character, distinguished from others by his
        particular style of classicizing attire and by the fact that he is always depicted doing a specific action with
        his hands. Interestingly, this man resembles the portrait of Maier himself on page 11 of certain 1618 copies of
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. (See essay by <span><a href="/front-matter/getacquainted/printing/" target="_blank">Stephen Tabor</a></span>.) He imparts an impression of being middle-aged based on his body type and chiseled facial features. He is well-groomed, mustachioed and
        bearded with a close-cropped hairstyle. He wears a muscle cuirass and pteruges (strips of leather hanging from
        either the shoulders or waist as a skirt), and on occasion he sports a cloak. His boots reach mid-calf, and
        while they vary in design (sometimes plain, sometimes striped) they are characterized by being turned over at
        the top with a centrally placed decorative ornament. The reader first encounters him in <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="4">Emblem 4</a></span> where he stands at the edge of a path, proffering
        the “cup of love” to the “brother” and “sister” who embrace in its middle.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="8">Emblem 8</a></span>, he raises a “fiery” sword above
        a giant egg. In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="9">Emblem 9</a></span>, he is the “old
        man” [<em>senex</em>] seated inside the “bedewed house” [<em>rorida domo</em>] who plucks a gold apple from a
        tree therein with his right hand and is about to bite into another apple that he holds in his left. All of these
        actions relate to alchemical processes, a point that applies to the other emblems in which he appears.

Mittere autem secundum similitudinem est recipere aquam illarum per alembicum in recipiente.” Cf. <em>Atalanta running</em>, 109: “But by mountains he signifies Curcurbits, and by the tops of mountains Alembics . . .”'>71</a></sup>
        Discourse 7 characterizes “the mountain top” featured in the emblem as an alembic, and Discourse 34 makes
        further reference to mountains and mountain tops as symbolic representations of curcurbits and alembics.
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is thus an allegorical laboratory where this Maier-like character as alchemist
        undertakes the Great Work of making the philosophers’ stone.

        In mythology, the dragon is the custodian of treasure, and this is Ladon’s role in the Garden of the Hesperides.
        He is depicted in the title page directly above Atalanta, who is rendered in the act of picking up a golden
        apple during her race with Hippomenes. The Latin block text of the title itself separates the dragon and the
        woman, and what is divided in the title page becomes rejoined in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="50">Emblem 50</a></span>. Whether by chance or design, the Arabic numeral “50” in the title
        lies halfway between Ladon and Atalanta—and it is the centermost point in the title page itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Maier indeed constructed <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a game, then this feature of the book disappears with
        its reissue in 1687. Published sixty-five years after Maier’s death, and retitled as <em>Secretioris naturae
          secretorum scrutinium chymicum</em> (The Chymical Investigation of the Most Secret Nature of Secrets), this
        edition omits the title page from <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as well as its music, excisions that completely
        change how the book is read. This in fact creates two distinctly different versions of Maier’s emblem book.
        Moreover, the question of how a seventeenth-century reader might have experienced Maier’s work is immediately
        complicated by numerous contemporary variants, presenting a constellation of <em>Atalanta</em>-objects each with
        a different interface, illuminating whole new sets of possibilities for reading <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        This essay presents a first step in evaluating the question of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> encipherment, and what
        is intriguing about this perspective is the ambiguity that enables us to read Maier’s musical alchemical emblem
        book in this way. This turns the question into why we could, or should, read <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a work
        of steganography, as doing so allows us to build promising new narratives of interpretation. The implications of
        this hypothesis generate starting points for investigations into relationships between <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, Lullian combinatorial arts, music, and the art of memory, and of an epistemology of playfulness
        in early modern intellectual culture around knowledge production and games.<sup><a

        Given the diverse and extensive scholarship on <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> to date, perhaps one reason why this
        book has not as yet been studied as steganographic is because no one suspected it to be.<sup><a href="#"

        A well-enciphered message is not just one that defies cracking, but also one that escapes notice.

      <h2>Author Biography</h2>
      <p><strong>Donna Bilak</strong> holds a Ph.D. from Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture. A historian of early modern alchemy,
        she specializes in the study of emblematics. Her research interests extend to jewelry history and technology,
        which draw upon her previous professional experience in Toronto's jewelry industry as a designer and wax model
        maker. Her scholarship centers on material practices of humanism both in the early modern period and in
        contemporary society; namely, how intersections of text, images, and the creative and experimental use of
        materials come together in the creation and application of knowledge.</p>
