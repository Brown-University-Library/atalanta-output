        Until now, scholarly consensus has held that Michael Maier composed the fifty alchemical “fugues” that serve as
        one of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> (1618) most distinctive features.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Citations are printed here in order of publication date, earliest to latest.

        Maier’s authorship of the design, text, and music of each emblem has been central to the critical reception of
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> since, at least, Helen Joy Sleeper’s groundbreaking study of the book in 1938, which
        sought an organic unity of conception both within each emblem and across the progression of the collection’s
        fifty emblems. This essay will detail my recent discovery that the lion’s share of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em>
        fugues were not composed by Michael Maier. Rather, forty of the collection’s fifty fugues had been published in
        1591 in London by the composer John Farmer as <em>Divers & Sundry Waies of Two Parts in One, to the Number of Fortie upon one Playnsong</em>. Only ten of
        the fifty fugues formerly ascribed to Maier were likely composed by the German alchemist, whose command of the
        complexities of canonic composition appears not quite equal to his facility with Latin poetics and mastery of
        the alchemical corpus. Where and how did Maier encounter Farmer’s obscure book of canons? And why did he choose
        to adapt an old-fashioned and esoteric English musical idiom to his erudite emblem book? As we will explore in
        subsequent pages, the discovery of the true authorship of Maier’s fugues raises numerous historical and
        interpretive questions that have the potential to reframe how we read (and sing and hear) <em>Atalanta
          fugiens’</em> alchemical music.

        In <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> opening pages, Maier explains how the fifty alchemical fugues support the
        collection’s complex and multivalent alchemical program:

            “rule”)</span>

              one or more parts, either at the unison (i.e., the same pitch) or at some other pitch. A round is a
              type of canon, but in a round each voice, when it finishes, can start at the beginning again so that
              the piece can go “round and round,” as with “Frère Jacques” or “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.”</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong> that the Italian term <em>fuga</em>, as used by Maier, is not interchangeable with the
              modern term “fugue.” Rather, <em>fuga</em>, borrowed from Renaissance music theorist and composer Gioseffo
              Zarlino, was the preferred term for “canon” in German-speaking lands.</p>

        The personification of Atalanta, Hippomenes and the golden apples (<em>Pomum morans</em>) as, respectively, the
        leading voice, the following voice and the <em>cantus firmus</em> of each fugue is enlisted by Maier to evoke
        the three key elements of transmutational alchemy (mercury, sulfur, and salt), as well as three stages of the
        alchemical process (<em>nigredo</em>, <em>albedo</em>, and <em>rubedo</em>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Godwin, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 18.'>3</a></sup> By the early seventeenth century the
        alchemical corpus had thoroughly digested both an allegorical conception of the holy Trinity and a parallel
        Hermetic narrative that traced alchemy’s deep roots in three-fold assemblages to Hermes Trismegistus, literally
        “thrice-greatest” Hermes. Had Maier been aware of the identity of the <em>cantus firmus</em>—the second phrase
        of the Kyrie trope <em>Cunctipotens genitor Deus</em> (All-Powerful Creator)—on which John Farmer based the
        canons that Maier transformed into <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> fugues, Maier might have appreciated the resonance
        between the fugues as they appeared in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and the Kyrie itself (with its threefold
        repetition of its three statements).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Rebotier, “Music of the Cantilenae,” [2].'>4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the last century, numerous scholars have sought to explain Maier’s nuanced vision of music’s
        role in alchemical gnosis. Though historians have identified several points of contact between surviving
        writings on alchemy and early modern musical sources, <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> fifty fugues represent a unique
        and unparalleled confluence. The central concerns of previous scholarship on <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> music
        have been the role of music in Maier’s cosmography—especially in relation to classical sources on music such as
        Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Boethius—and the identification of potential musical antecedents of the fugues (such
        as the origin of the ubiquitous cantus firmus melody, and contemporaneous theoretical writings on music by, for
        example, Johannes Lippius and Sethus Calvisius). Hildemarie Streich’s voluminous prefatory essay in Joscelyn
        Godwin’s 1989 translation of <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> offers, as do several earlier treatments, close readings
        of various fugues seeking to map specific musical features to particular emblems’ programs, as well as to the
        trajectory of the book as a whole. In nearly all cases, scholars have stumbled over obvious inconsistencies in
        the quality of the collection’s fifty compositions.

      </div>

        As Jacques Rebotier has documented, Maier’s published corpus reveals something of a fixation on music in
        triparte constructions, a fact that has not eluded music historians seeking early sources on the musical
        triad.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Johannes Lippius, in fact, is now widely credited with the first “modern” theoretical treatment of the musical triad, a possibility discussed in Raasveld, “Michael Maiers <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.”'>5</a></sup>
        Maier’s <em>Symbola aureae mensae</em> (Symbols of the Golden Table, 1617), <em>Jocus severus</em> (A Severe
        Joke, 1617), and <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> (Intellectual Songs, 1622) all contain passages on music,
        though no comprehensive scholarly treatment of music in Maier’s substantial corpus currently exists. Unlike the
        highly figurative <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em>, in which a different poetic text is assigned to each of
        the three musical “voices” (<em>acuta</em>, <em>media</em>, and <em>gravis</em>) of each “song,” <em>Atalanta
          fugiens’</em> fugues are notated music that could certainly have been sung.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> contain no musical notation. See Leibenguth, <em>Hermetische Poesie</em>.'>6</a></sup>
        Maier’s instructions in <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> title specify that he intended the volume’s contents “be
        seen, read, meditated, Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard,” and in most (though not all) cases the layout
        of canonic material on the page allows for real-time performance.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . videnda, legenda, meditanda, intelligenda, dijudicanda, canenda & audienda.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [1]. This and all English translations from <em>Atalanta running</em>, Beinecke Library, unless otherwise noted.'>7</a></sup>
        On the other hand, Maier’s association in <em>Cantilenae intellectuales</em> of a constellation of references to
        the “silence” of <em>musica speculativa</em> with “the (alchemical) micro-world, comprising, as it does, three
        natures expressed as three voices (high-pitched, medium and bass)” suggests that a sensitive reader of
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> might hear quite a lot in the silent contemplation of Maier’s musical notation.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Rebotier, “Music of the Cantilenae,” [5].'>8</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In general terms, <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> fugues support the book’s alchemical program in at least two
        important ways. First, the fugues provide a musical representation of Atalanta’s race with Hippomenes, the
        book’s master trope that Maier freights with layers of alchemical allegory.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For additional historical background on canonic symbolism and triparte construction, see Elders, “Canon and Imitation.”'>9</a></sup>
        Second, vocal chamber music serves as a figure for the sociality Maier sought to cultivate with his alchemical
        emblem book. Assuming that the fugues were actually sung (an assumption I examine in more detail below), they
        would have required the presence of at least three singers, a quorum of participants that evokes the sociality
        of alchemical practices in courts, artisanal workshops, and chymical clubs. Relatedly, if Maier intended
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a showpiece of erudition designed to secure him a new patron, his inclusion of
        accessible but sophisticated vocal chamber music was a wise—if ultimately unsuccessful—stratagem.

        John Farmer (b. ca. 1570; fl. 1591–1601) is known to scholars of English Renaissance music from his numerous
        four-part settings in Thomas East’s psalter of 1592, his <em>First Set of English Madrigals</em> (1600), and his
        contribution to the very popular madrigal anthology dedicated to Elizabeth I, the <em>Triumphs of Oriana</em>
        (1601). Less well known is Farmer’s first publication, <em>Divers & Sundry Waies of Two Parts in One, to the Number of Fortie upon one Playnsong</em> (henceforth <em>Sundry Waies</em>), published “in youth” in 1591 and
        dedicated to Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, in whose household Farmer may have lived for
        several years (<strong>fig. 1</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Bowling, “Transcription and Comparative Analysis”; Ward, “Seventeenth Earl of Oxford.”'>10</a></sup>
        John Farmer of Leicester and a “generous family” matriculated at Oxford’s Merton College on March 27, 1584, aged
        eighteen.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Mar. 27; Mert.; Farmer, John; Leic., gen. f., 18.” Clark, “Part II Matriculations and Subscriptions.”'>11</a></sup>
        Farmer next appears as an organist and master of choristers at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, a position he
        began on February 1, 1595 and held until, likely, 1599 when he returned to London.<sup><a href="#"

        Plainsong canons, or waies (as they appear in Farmer’s title), were central to the musical culture that
        surrounded John Farmer during the final decades of the sixteenth century. Thomas Morley’s discussion of waies in
        his <em>Plaine and easie introduction to practicall musicke</em> (1597) stretches to ten full pages with
        numerous musical examples, including waies by Morley himself, William Byrd, and Osbert Parsley.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Morley, <em>A plaine and easie introduction</em>, 96–105.'>13</a></sup>
        Morley’s treatise, dedicated to “the most excellent musitian maister William Byrde,” synthesizes much
        sixteenth-century musical learning from across Europe and remains a touchstone of music theory and compositional
        practice of the period.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Morley’s treatment of plainsong canon was influenced—like so much else in his <em>Plaine and easie introduction</em>—by Zarlino’s detailed treatment of the topic in part III of the <em>Istitutioni</em>. However, because Morley’s discussion of waies, published in English in during the 1580s, is so proximate to our topic, I will privilege his writing on the idiom.'>14</a></sup>
        Morley, who graduated BMus from Oxford in 1588, was one of a circle musicians who composed and improvised waies
        (and almost certainly used them in their teaching) during the 1580s and 90s when the idiom was something of a

          Surviving sources of waies share an impressive breadth of canonic technique, including a systematic display of
          canons at different temporal and musical intervals. They also rely on a surprisingly small number of plainsong
          <em>cantus firmi</em>, the most popular by far being the <em>Miserere mihi</em>.<sup><a href="#"

        Farmer’s use of the second phrase of Kyrie IV (<strong>Cunctipotens genitor Deus</strong>) as the basis of all
        of the canons in <em>Sundry Waies</em> is striking because the melody was better known on the continent and had a much
        less conspicuous history in England (<strong>fig. 2</strong>). The particular version of the plainsong used by
        Farmer is a near perfect match with the Kyrie IV melody as it was first printed in the <em>Sarum graduale</em>
        during the middle of the fifteenth century.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        In her 1938 article, Sleeper identified Kyrie IV as the source of the <em>Pomum morans</em> melody in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> fugues, though her assumption (shared by subsequent scholars) that Maier was their
        composer introduced some confusion about how that particular melody might have found its way onto the pages of
        Maier’s book.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Sleeper, <em>Alchemical Fugues</em>, 413.'>18</a></sup> In the 1573 edition of the
        <em>Istitutioni</em> (first edition 1558), perhaps the most influential composition treatise across late
        sixteenth-century Europe, Gioseffo Zarlino provides a plainsong canon that uses the first phrase of Kyrie IV,
        and in <em>Melopoeia</em> (1592), the German theorist Sethus Calvisius introduced the second phrase of Kyrie IV
        (the same melody that appears in Farmer and subsequently in Maier) in his discussion of canon.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Zarlino, <em>Istitutioni</em>, 309; Calvisius, <em>Melopoeia</em>, ch. 20.'>19</a></sup>
        Whether Maier initially encountered Kyrie IV in Zarlino or in Calvisius (who is widely credited with
        transmitting Zarlino’s ideas to German lands), or perhaps somewhere else, remains a matter of speculation. As
        Giuseppe Gerbino has documented, there was some continental interest during the early seventeenth century in
        plainsong canon, which Gerbino refers to, following Zarlino, as <em>contrappunto obbligato</em>.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Gerbino, <em>Canoni</em>, 36–40.'>20</a></sup> For our purposes,
        though, given that Maier chose to appropriate an English composer’s waies built on an English variant of Kyrie
        IV, I will focus my discussion on waies in the English context.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Calvisius’ Melopoeia transmitted to German many of Zarlino’s ideas and terms from his <em>Istitutioni</em>, including Zarlino’s use of the word <em>fuga</em> for canon.'>21</a></sup>

          The popularity of waies among English musicians during the late sixteenth century has remained something of a
          mystery. A miniature form seemingly designed to showcase abstruse contrapuntal machinations, waies
          proliferated at a moment when the text-driven expressivity and larger forms of the <em>seconda prattica</em>
          were ascendant in England. With a few notable exceptions, forthright, largely homophonic psalm and hymn
          settings were displacing centuries of complex polyphony as the musical vehicle for the (now Protestant)
          liturgy. Waies typically feature two parts in canon accompanied by (or accompanying) a liturgical chant
          excerpt used as a pfundnote cantus firmus, a slow-moving melody in long notes of unvarying length.

        Waies typically feature two parts in canon accompanied by (or accompanying) a liturgical chant excerpt used as a
        <em>pfundnote cantus firmus</em>, a slow-moving melody in long notes of unvarying length. The tradition of
        sacralizing a liturgical melody by garlanding it with polyphonic accompaniment had been central to European
        composition for hundreds of years. However, the wholesale, violent reorganization of the liturgy by English
        Reformers meant that the melodies and associated Latin texts of the Sarum Rite—the dominant rite in Southern
        England prior to the Reformation—were no longer in common use. The appearance of Sarum chant melodies in waies
        published during some of the most intensely anti-Catholic years of Elizabeth I’s reign suggests that their use
        as <em>cantus firmi</em> was more than incidental. At the very least, the use of such melodies as the
        <em>Miserere mihi</em> and <em>Cunctipotens genitor Deus</em> by waies composers gestured to an earlier musical
        era when musical canon was strongly associated with ritual symbolism, a tradition that persisted in various
        forms through at least the early seventeenth century.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, for example, the Trinity-themed canons by Elway Bevin or the <em>Jesu autem transiens</em> canon that appears in sources as early and late, respectively, as the Eton Choirbooks and the Baldwin Manuscript.'>22</a></sup>
        However, the use of Sarum melodies as <em>cantus firmi</em> in the waies corpus suggests that composers of waies
        were interested not just in the tradition of polyphony as a ritual enhancement of the musical Word as expressed
        in now-outlawed Sarum chant melodies, but in the particular Catholic associations of the melodies themselves.
        Yet even if we accept the notion that waies composition was partly motivated by an attraction to Sarum chant,
        myriad questions remain. Why were these collections published? Who was their intended audience, and how did
        their authors envision their use? And how and why was the Lutheran Maier drawn to the waies idiom as a source
        for <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em> music?
      </p>
      <p>
        The contrapuntal virtuosity that characterizes the waies corpus, with its encyclopedic treatments of canonic
        possibility, suggests that the display of compositional skill was at least a factor in the circulation and
        publication of waies.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Regarding the depth of the waies corpus see, for example, the 1,163 waies on the <em>Miserere mihi cantus firmus</em> in Cambridge University Library, MS Dd.iv.60; Collins, “Sufficient to Quench.”'>23</a></sup>
        Yet the most ostentatious feature of the waies corpus—its stubborn reliance on bits of plainchant associated
        with a forbidden ritual practice—is incidental to its displays of compositional complexity. After all, composers
        eager to display contrapuntal cunning could just as easily have composed canons <em>not</em> on a plainsong, or
        could have chosen popular melodies or scalar patterns as the basis of their waies. Eamon Duffy famously
        documented the crisis of the sudden proscription of familiar rites following several waves of violent religious
        reform, the extent to which “the Reformation was a stripping away of familiar and beloved observances, the
        destruction of a vast and resonant world of symbols.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Duffy, <em>Stripping of the Altars</em>, 591.'>24</a></sup> Despite strenuous official
        efforts to purge the country of Catholic ritual artefacts—missals, books of hours, vestments, rood screens,
        “idolatrous” images, etc.—a surprising number of such ritual items were saved by enterprising clergy and
        parishioners. Many such items, as Duffy chronicles, either retained their ritual significance as part of the
        surreptitious and piecemeal practice of those who resisted Reformers’ efforts, or they were stripped of some or
        all of their former ritual power to become incorporated into the new structures of belief and practice. One such
        ritual vestige of the old religion to survive the Reformation in various, not altogether unrecognizable forms
        was a selection of plainchant melodies of the Sarum Rite, a formerly enormous corpus that had served as the core
        of the musical liturgy for centuries.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Aplin, “Survival of Plainsong”; Benham, “Latin Church Music”; Bowers, “Chapel Royal”; Daniel, “Contrafacta and Polyglot Texts”; Haigh, “Continuity of Catholicism”; Hughes, “Continuity, Tradition and Change”; Kerman, “Music and Politics”; Milsom, “Songs, Carols and ‘Contrafacta’”; Monson, “Byrd, The Catholics, and the Motet”; Willis, <em>Church Music and Protestantism</em>.'>25</a></sup>
        Stripped of their incriminating Latin texts, these melodies appear frequently in Elizabethan music, often in
        self-consciously antiquated musical forms, such as the <em>In nomine</em> for ensembles of viols, that harken
        back to a sacralizing pre-Reformation musical sensibility. It is perhaps no coincidence that a preponderance of
        the Elizabethan polyphony that makes use of plainchant melodies (in both their texted and untexted forms) was
        composed by musicians who had chosen to maintain ties—often at great personal and professional expense—to the
        old religion. The waies idiom emerged out of a community of just such composers, musicians who managed—using
        varied strategies and with varying degrees of success—to preserve professional identities as composers in a
        virulently anti-Catholic culture while creating music that gestured in a range of ways towards their
        confessional allegiance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered as an adjunct to the education of choristers, waies publications—including Farmer’s <em>Sundry
          Waies</em>—would have offered flexible teaching materials and variously coded gestures to venerated musical
        and liturgical traditions that had only been papered over by the new psalters and prayer book. There is no
        evidence that Farmer harbored Catholic sympathies, yet as a musician with many connections to the liturgy he
        would have been aware of the persistent ritual and musical absences of the new official religion as well as,
        most likely, the extent to which proscribed practices lay everywhere beneath the surface.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“For the conformity of the majority did not mean the end of traditional religion. Instead, slowly, falteringly, much reduced in scope, depth, and coherence, it re-formed itself around the rituals, and words of the prayer-book.” Duffy, <em>Stripping of the Altars</em>, 589.'>26</a></sup>
        Singing Farmer’s waies, for example, would have quickly lodged in the memory the excerpt of the <em>Cunctipotens
          genitor Deus</em> chant melody on which Farmer based his canons and that appears at the top of each page of
        <em>Sundry Waies</em>. Singing and memorizing chant had been the principal occupation of choristers for
        centuries, and though Farmer’s collection is purportedly focused on canonic composition, that fact is that
        accessing its lessons requires a repetition and memorization of a Sarum chant melody that would have offered
        Elizabethan musicians multiple registers of continuity with the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the waies corpus may have been a vehicle for educating choristers about how to sing—as opposed to
        compose—liturgical polyphony is further suggested by the nearly complete absence in any treatise (aside from
        Morley’s) of the sort of nuts-and-bolts compositional strategies that we see in, for example, Zarlino’s
        <em>Istitutioni</em>. Virtually all the known composers of waies served as masters of choristers (Farmer held
        such a position in Ireland after he graduated from Oxford and published <em>Sundry Waies</em>), whose
        responsibilities included training students to sing the high-pitched “treble” and “mean” vocal parts essential
        to the musical liturgy. A master of choristers needed musical exercises to train his charges, exercises that
        could serve the mix of vocal ranges and skill levels possessed by a motley group of choristers ranging in age
        from six or seven years old to the late teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farmer’s collection of canons would have offered a valuable set of exercises in singing and playing notated
        polyphony as well as graded models for aspiring composers. <em>Sundry Waies</em> is organized by clef grouping
        (<strong>fig. 3</strong>), providing a collection of pieces that fairly evenly distribute the plainsong and the
        leading and following canonic voices through all possible vocal and instrumental ranges. Of the collection’s
        forty canons, there are examples that would comfortably fit the vocal ranges of any possible combination of
        three singers, from the highest treble to the lowest bass possessed by an older boy who had not yet found a
        place as an adult singing man. Alternately, students playing any combination of the three traditional sizes of
        viol could have found a canon to practice reading different clefs and performing simple polyphony
        together.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In <em>Early History of the Viol</em>, Ian Woodfield has chronicled the role of the viola da gamba (“viol” in England) in the musical training of choristers during—especially—the second half of the sixteenth century. In choir schools, the instrument was used to help teach music notation (“pricksong”) and the ensemble skills, important to professional singers of liturgical music, necessary to perform complex polyphony.'>27</a></sup>
        In one scenario, the teacher might have used the leading voice of a particular waie to model solmization and
        style while students performed the following voice and supported the proceedings with the <em>cantus
          firmus</em>. Alternatively, two advanced students or groups of students might have sung the canonic voices
        while the teacher reinforced good rhythm and intonation through his performance of the accompanying plainsong.
        Farmer’s <em>Sundry Waies</em> could also have served as a veritable encyclopedia of canonic techniques for
        advanced students learning to compose imitative polyphony or improvise counterpoint against a <em>cantus
          firmus</em>. Waies’ conventional absence of texts would have facilitated the use of the hexachordal
        syllables—ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la—by young singers developing their solmization skills. Music of known
        pedagogical intent from the same period and publisher features both texted and untexted exercises in a similar
        bid for maximal flexibility.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The surviving waies corpus (see <span><a href="#table1" class="anchor">Table 1, “waies sources”</a></span>) 
        testifies to a brief but intense fascination with this esoteric idiom. The purported educational value of waies
        as an aid to teaching composition and/or performance does not seem adequate to explain the seemingly obsessive
        generation of dozens or hundreds of short canons to just a couple short snippets of ancient plainsong. The
        Catholic sympathies of nearly all the known composers of waies (Farmer notwithstanding), as well as the
        conspicuous choice of <em>cantus firmi</em> drawn from a proscribed rite, suggest that the idiom may have served
        retrospective or symbolic—alongside musical—purposes to its small community of enthusiasts. The combinatory
        fervor evident in what appear to have been somewhat systematic attempts to present all the possible canons
        against a given <em>cantus firmus</em> may have been an English take on similarly ideologically charged
        combinatory efforts by various Jesuit thinkers (among them Cristoph Clavius and, later, Athanasius Kircher) on
        the continent.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Ludwig, “‘Marketh it Well’”; Knobloch, “Musurgia Universalis”; Gerbino, “Gli arcani.”'>29</a></sup>
        What is certainly true is that the English waies corpus brought people together to sing, play, or compose, to
        learn, practice, or worship, in moments of collaborative musical intimacy.

        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ presentation of Farmer’s waies is legible as <em>imitation</em>, the strategic
        concealing and revealing of different sources to different readers, all in the context of the broader problem of
        publishing alchemical secrets while reserving core truths for the initiated reader. Maier’s close connection to
        Jacobean England—his visits to the court during 1611–1616, his publication in London of the <em>Arcana
          arcanissima</em> (Most Secret Secrets, 1614), <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ silent transmission of an English
        musical form, etc.—contributes to an emerging reevaluation of the influence of English culture on the continent
        during the first decades of the seventeenth century. Karin Figala and Ulrich Neumann have identified several
        notable Englishmen to whom Maier wrote personal dedications in surviving copies of the <em>Arcana
          arcanissima</em>. One, Sir William Paddy (1554–1634), personal physician to James I, is of interest as the
        potential vector of Farmer’s <em>Sundry Waies</em> to Maier. Paddy was an amateur musician associated throughout
        his life with Oxford, having graduated from St. John’s College and later leaving his estate, including an organ
        and £1800 “for the improvement of the choir,” to St. John’s.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Figala and Neumann, “Michael Maier (1569–1622),” 44; Kassel, “Paddy, Sir William.”'>30</a></sup>
        While John Farmer had matriculated to Merton College, a few blocks away, William Bathe, a Catholic composer of
        waies who is quoted by Maier in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ introduction, had been a student at St. John’s during
        the 1580s and would have likely known both Farmer and Paddy. It is also possible that Maier encountered Farmer’s
        <em>Sundry Waies</em> on the continent; dances by Farmer appear in Thomas Simpson’s <em>Opusculum neuwer
          Pavanen</em>, published in Heidelberg in 1610, so the composer was not entirely unknown in Maier’s Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        However Maier got his hands on Farmer’s collection of waies, he left a few breadcrumbs in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> that hint at the depth of his engagement with the English waies tradition. <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>’ preface reveals unmistakable references both to Farmer’s preface in <em>Sundry Waies</em> and to
        the epigraph and preface (“To the Reader”) from William Bathe’s waies collection, <em>A briefe introduction to
          the skill of song</em> (c. 1596). Additionally, one or more of Maier’s emblems (<span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="6">6</a></span> and <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="42">42</a></span>, for example) may
        slyly gesture towards his surreptitious repurposing of Farmer’s canons.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The epigram of Emblem 42 (“In Chymicis versant Natura, Ratio, Experientia & lectio, sint Dux, scipio, perspicilia & lampas”) mentions “<em>dux</em>” and “<em>comes</em>”—words that describe the image (Nature leads and the Chymist follows in her footsteps) and also happen to be musico-theoretical technical terms for the leading and following voices of a musical canon.'>31</a></sup>

        A careful reading of Farmer’s prefatory essay “<em>Philomusicis</em>” alongside Maier’s <em>praefatio</em>
        reveals multiple points of contact, from the parallel treatment—in roughly the same order—of the themes of
        divine omniscience and the hierarchy of knowledge as represented by the seven liberal arts, to specific
        citations and turns of phrase. Though some similarities are no doubt due to both authors’ employment of a richly
        conventional tradition of prefatory address, specific references in both prefaces to the story of Themistocles,
        for example, and his famed inability to play the lyre appear too specific to be easily explained by coincidence
        or convention. This is true also of both Farmer’s and Maier’s distinctive rhetoric asserting that their
        respective arts (Farmer’s music and Maier’s chymistry) are “not the last, if not the first,” (Farmer) or “not
        the meanest, but next to . . . divine things, the principal and most precious of all,” (Maier) in the hierarchy
        of knowledge.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        More surprising is Maier’s quotation of William Bathe’s treatise on waies, the aforementioned <em>Briefe
          introduction</em>, written while the Irish Catholic Bathe was a student at Oxford during the mid-1580s
        alongside Morley and Farmer. The title page of Bathe’s <em>Briefe introduction</em> features an epigram ascribed
        to “Fabius”—presumably Marcus Fabius Quintilianus—whose writings on rhetoric and music were a standard part of
        an English gentleman’s education in the liberal arts. Quintilian’s <em>Institutio oratoria</em> (Institutes of
        Oratory), in fact, is a likely source of the story about Themistocles cited by Farmer and Maier. Bathe’s
        epigram, “music is an honest and agreeable recreation, most worthy of liberal and learned persons,” does not
        appear in any of Quintilian’s known writings, nor was I able to find it in a fairly exhaustive search of
        classical sources on music known in England during the sixteenth century.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . musica est honestum et iucundum oblectamentum, liber alibus ingeniis maxime dignum.” Bathe, <em>Briefe introduction</em>.'>33</a></sup>
        Where it does appear, however, similarly (and perhaps erroneously) ascribed to “Fabius,” is in Maier’s
        <em>praefatio</em>, where it concludes Maier’s discussion of music as a key element in <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>’ multi-modal conception. It would appear that Maier was familiar, therefore, not just with
        Farmer’s collection of waies but also with Bathe’s, suggesting that Maier’s selection of Farmer’s canons was an
        informed and considered choice.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='It is worth noting that a single, well-timed visit to Thomas East’s printing house on Aldersgate Street in London could have provided Maier with both Bathe’s and Farmer’s collections of waies.'>34</a></sup>
        One extraordinary feature of Bathe’s <em>Briefe introduction</em> is the inclusion of a tabular algorithm for
        the composition of waies—a sort of paint-by-number technique for composing canons “to the plainsong.” It is
        possible that Maier used Bathe’s table to help him compose the ten fugues he likely contributed to <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>, though it would be difficult to know for certain. It is more probable that Maier closely (though
        imperfectly) imitated Farmer’s examples, which were likely not composed with the aid of Bathe’s
        algorithm.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='There is no evidence that Bathe’s table circulated prior to its publication c. 1596.'>35</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The paradigmatic alterations Maier made to Farmer’s canons can be expressed quite simply: Maier transposed all
        of Farmer’s canons up a fourth, set to them the Latin epigrams that appear beneath as part of each emblem, and
        scrambled the order in which Farmer had presented his canons in <em>Sundry Waies</em> (see Table 2).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='In the many cases where Maier’s transposition would have resulted in impossible vocal ranges (such as Maier’s Emblem 22, Farmer’s canon 3), Maier transposed the highest voice down an octave.'>36</a></sup>
        In order to make the Latin words fit music for which they weren’t initially conceived, Maier freely broke long
        notes into shorter values, particularly the semibreves that comprise the <em>cantus firmus</em>, or <em>Pomum
          morans</em> in his Atalantan conception of the pieces. In all cases, only the first of the three verses of
        each epigram underlays the music, which is printed—like Farmer’s canons—in choirbook format on one page.

        In his <em>Melopoeia</em> of 1592, the German music theorist and astronomer Calvisius articulated a rationale
        for adding text to textless music that calls to mind Maier’s exhortation to his readers that “The Emblems
        presents themselves to your eyes, as the fugue does to your ears, But let your Reason strive for the arcane
        interpretations.” Calvisius writes,
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="left-space">
          although a bare [textless] harmony such as is found in instrumental music, when intelligently and skillfully
          wrought by an artist, may reach men’s minds by virtue of its numbers and proportions and exert great power in
          arousing the affections, nevertheless, if one adds a human voice which at the same time sings a significant
          idea portrayed in harmonic numbers, the melody will become much more elevated, more welcome both to the ears
          and to the mind, because of the twofold delight which the harmony and the noble idea will engender.<sup><a

        Maier was a gifted epigrammatist, and perhaps couldn’t resist “elevating” Farmer’s enticingly “bare harmony”
        with the addition of “noble ideas.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For those readers eager to identify connections among the elements of a given emblem (the fuga, engraving,
        epigram, and discursus), comparing Farmer’s and Maier’s tables of contents may suggest which <em>fugues</em> are
        most likely to reward close reading. Those series of emblems in which Maier scrambled Farmer’s order (in order
        to align salient musical features with related themes in the accompanying engraving, epigram, or discursus) are
        likely richer in intra-emblematic connections than those series where Maier simply reproduced Farmer’s canons in
        their original order.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, for emblems 22–29 and 35–40, Maier used Farmer’s canons in the same order he encountered them in
        Farmer’s collection. In contrast, Maier carefully selected the most complex and evocative of Farmer’s canons for
        his final ten fugues. It is in these final ten fugues that musical details of a particular fugue can most easily
        be interpreted to manifest the overarching themes of the emblem to which it belongs.

        Maier chose Farmer’s canon 38, a retrograde canon in which the canonic voices proceed, in Farmer’s words,
        “ . . . backward and forward, the one part to begin at the beginning and so [to] the ende, and the other part to
        begin at the ende, and so forward to the beginning, the plainsong likewise, is to be sung forward and
        backward . . . ” The image of two eagles flying in opposite directions and then returning is echoed in (or
        echoes) a performance of the fugue, in which the two canonic parts read the same line from opposite directions
        and the <em>cantus firmus</em> is “out of Delphi sent,” and then returns to its starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first twenty fugues present another snapshot of Maier’s process of adapting Farmer’s canons to <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>. Of the first twenty fugues, the odd-numbered ones (1–19) do not appear in Farmer’s <em>Sundry
          Waies</em>. Circumstantial evidence points to Maier as the composer of these pieces, which imitate Farmer’s
        canons while exhibiting substantially less contrapuntal facility. A close look at the odd-numbered fugues 1–19
        reveals myriad contrapuntal errors of numerous sorts. <em>Fuga</em> 1, the opening piece of the collection, for
        example, is rife with infelicities that include parallel perfect intervals, improperly handled dissonances, and
        melodic tritones. In their theoretical writings on the composition of waies back in England, both Morley and
        Bathe described a method that entails first composing a canon in whole notes against the <em>cantus firmus</em>,
        and then introducing diminutions in the canonic voices (<strong>fig. 5</strong>).<sup><a href="#"

      <p>
        Each of these two phases of the composition of waies entails its own set of skills to master and invites its own
        distinctive errors. The fugues that originated as Farmer’s canons exhibit orthodox treatment of consonance and
        dissonance, and inventive diminutions to create frequent suspensions, syncopations, and melodic interest through
        the use of varying rhythmic values. The fugues I ascribe to Maier, on the other hand, include frequent
        contrapuntal errors that originate at the structural, canonic level (<strong>fig. 6</strong>) as well as those
        introduced in the diminutions.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='<em>Atalanta fugiens</em> also includes an incomplete and somewhat confused table of errata, many items of which do not succeed in fixing errors in the fugues to which they refer, and some of which actually contribute additional errors (see, for example, errata 6 and 27).'>40</a></sup>
        The fugues by Maier also reveal significant confusion about the use of <em>musica ficta</em>, the chromatic
        alteration of melody in response to contrapuntal exigencies that was an essential skill for literate musicians.
        Fugues 5, 9, and 11, for example, present numerous errors that are representative of Maier’s evident confusion
        about the correct application of <em>ficta</em>.

        Existing scholarship on the music in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> has had to account for the curious inconsistency
        of quality evident in the fugues. It is now clear the forty fugues that originated as canons by John Farmer meet
        the period’s professional standards of composition, while the remaining ten fugues are evidently the work of an
        ambitious amateur attempting to imitate Farmer’s well-wrought models. The only surviving composition that can
        (somewhat) dependably be ascribed to Maier is a waie, featuring four canonic voices over a repeating <em>cantus
          firmus</em>, that was included in a Christmas greeting presented to James I in 1611 while Maier was in England
        acting as an ambassador for Frederick, Elector Palatine. Adam McLean, who discovered the letter in the Scottish
        Records Office, noted that Maier’s Christmas greeting included a Rosicrucian-themed illustration paired with a
        Latin poem and a piece of music, a combination that prefigures <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ emblems. Like the
        fugues that would appear nearly a decade later, each voice of Maier’s canon for King James is matched to a
        character: in this case, the four archangels and two shepherds described elsewhere in the letter are designated
        to sing the four canonic voices and the <em>cantus firmus</em>, respectively. Also like the fugues not by Farmer
        in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Maier’s Christmas canon is rife with contrapuntal infelicities including
        unprepared dissonances, melodic tritones, parallel fourths in exposed voices, and awkward voice leading. While
        it is certainly possible that a different amateur composer completed the ten fugues in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
        not composed by Farmer, the familiarity of the types of errors and Maier’s evident interest in composing waies
        nearly a decade before the publication of his alchemical emblem book strongly suggest that Atalanta fugiens’
        poorly executed examples were composed by Maier himself.

        Until, that is, the last several lines, in which Maier veers unexpectedly away from an erudite meditation on how
        metals “grow” in the earth to a seemingly unrelated discussion of music.

        Yet his abrupt peroration, in which he furnishes an answer to one of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ most persistent
        questions (“Why music?”) to conclude an otherwise entirely unmusical emblem, might give a reader pause to
        consider Maier’s meta-commentary on his own work as an editor and compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ printed fugues tell a story about Maier’s appropriation of an esoteric musical
        idiom to his alchemical program, it’s important to remember that Maier would likely have encountered Farmer’s
        waies as <em>sounding</em> music, as an audible trace of an interaction among three musicians crowded around a
        copy of <em>Sundry Waies</em>. As they were printed by East, in a choirbook format featuring the plainsong
        across the top of the page with each of the canonic voices printed start to finish beneath it, Farmer’s canons
        require one musician per part (three in total) to perform. They would be extremely difficult for even the most
        skilled keyboard player to read at sight, and harder still for a musician to “audiate”—to hear in his/her
        head—given how they appear on the page.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='This is to say nothing of the problem posed to keyboard players by moving musical lines that cross “through” the held notes of the <em>cantus firmus</em>.'>44</a></sup>
        By way of contrast, consider Morley’s waies (<strong>fig. 5</strong>), printed in score in his <em>Plaine and
          easie introduction</em> in order to facilitate the study and performance of all three parts by one
        student.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Like Farmer, Bathe’s waies appear in choirbook format in <em>Briefe introduction</em>., while Bevin (<em>Briefe and short instruction</em>) and Simpson (<em>Compendium</em>) present their waies in score format.'>45</a></sup>
        The music is not the notation—Farmer’s waies are not (just) the three lines of music on each page of his
        treatise or the abstract set of canonic relationships the notation specifies; rather, they are brief scripted
        encounters that bring three individual musicians into a focused proximity, both physical (as they crowd around
        the book) and musical (through imitation and a preponderance of closely voiced intervals). Maier almost
        certainly would have discovered Farmer’s waies through his performance of them with—presumably—two friends in an
        English music room, an experience he may have sought to offer to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ readership.
      </p>
      <p>
        The several centuries that separate modern scholarship from Maier and his readers have also seen a shift away
        from oral performance—reading or singing aloud—towards silent, individual contemplation of the written word or
        note. Maier’s poetics in the <em>Cantilenae intellectuals</em> about silence as “music, audible only to
        philosophers” notwithstanding, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ fugues were likely conceived of primarily as sounding
        things, as short, ritual enactments of the same underlying universal order that the book’s chymistry was meant
        to reveal.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Rebotier’s translation of the <em>Cantilenae intellectuals</em>.'>46</a></sup> Like
        the clockwork planetaria that Rudolf II collected in Prague castle (in 1609 Maier entered Rudolf’s court as
        physician and counselor), the fugues offer the most to the senses when they are in motion, when the harmonious
        relationships they dramatize play out in real time. As Maier states in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’
        <em>praefatio</em>, “nothing is said to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense, the
        understanding of a man new born being supposed as a smooth table, wherein nothing is as yet written, but
        anything may be written by the help of sense, as a styl[us].”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

In the Beinecke translation of the <em>praefatio</em>, “stylus” is translated as “style.”'>47</a></sup>
        The “sound” of the fugues, as well as the accompanying sensory intensity of singing imitative polyphony as three
        characters in an Ovidian drama, may well have been a “stylus” with which Maier sought to inscribe the “most
        abstruse Chymical things, and lastly most rare Musical things to be enucleated by the understanding” on his
        readers’ intellects.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

      <p>
        Farmer’s waies, though designed to serve in a very different musical milieu—the small-group pedagogy of
        choristers in what remained of the choral institutions under Elizabeth I—were accessible only through
        performance by multiple musicians. It may have been the close choreography of Farmer’s polyphony—its capacity to
        stage a harmonious, intimate interaction among musical bodies—as much as its contrapuntal subtlety that drew
        Maier to Farmer’s canons. Though not Catholic, Farmer was close enough to the dispossessed community of Catholic
        musicians who created the waies idiom to have absorbed some of its ritual element—the quasi-liturgical unfolding
        of imitative lines against a hypnotic, inexorable bit of plainchant. This ritual intensity may be part of what
        Maier sought to import into <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, transforming it to serve the book’s ludic, quasi-mystical
        ends. The idea that Maier was drawn to the particular ritual intensity of waies (that he had perhaps experienced
        in England when he first sang or played them) also helps explain the sometimes seemingly random distribution of
        Farmer’s compositions in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. For if Maier included fugues in his alchemical emblem book
        as a way of intensifying the sensory and social dimensions of reading through the ritual intimacy of polyphonic
        music making, the exact mapping of a given fugue to the other elements of the emblem becomes a subsidiary
        consideration.

        The fact that we now know that eighty percent of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ fugues were conscripted from a
        publication with a radically different program—that of training English choristers in the performance and
        composition of counterpoint and promulgating a distinctively English retrospective musical mysticism—offers an
        opportunity to reorient <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ music with regard to its relationships to the book’s other
        elements. It also suggests critical vistas that include <em>both</em> the intratextuality of each emblem’s
        different elements and the myriad relationships between Maier’s erudite multimedia project and the rich
        circulation of sources and ideas across national and religious borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        At stake in evaluating Maier’s musical abilities has been a determination of the appropriate interpretive and
        critical responses to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ multimedia emblems. Scholars (including Sleeper, Streich, and
        Manfred Kelkel) who have been willing to overlook the curious and diverse errors that populate the fugues have
        pursued a close reading of canonic procedure to elucidate the emblems’ alchemical programs. Such work
        assumes—incorrectly, as we now know—that specific compositional choices are mappable to the textual and visual
        details of a given emblem’s accompanying elements (the epigram, engraving, and discursus).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Naturally, Maier’s conscription of preexisting polyphony in the assembly of forty of his fifty emblems suggests that one should be quite cautious in ascribing meaning to granular details of contrapuntal construction. And, in the case of the ten fugues likely composed by Maier, his evident difficulty staying within the rules of musical syntax suggests that he was not afforded much expressive choice beyond the basic exigencies of attempting (not always successfully) coherent canonic counterpoint.'>49</a></sup>
        Latent in this approach is a prioritizing of the textual and visual elements—the notion that the “essence” of a
        given emblem lies primarily in its visual and textual elements (the epigram and discursus) and that the fugue,
        like the accompanying engraving, serves to gloss and enrich it. The question of whether the fugues were intended
        to be actually sung is circumscribed by this issue of priority: the meanings that might emerge from an act of
        silent contemplation, or amidst the messy exigencies of crowding around the small book to sing, are inevitably
        tied to beliefs about how the music drives or is driven by the meanings of an emblem’s other elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modern embrace of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a multimedia text has been complicated by uncertainties about
        how involved Maier was in the conception and realization of the engravings, and by persistent doubts about his
        ability as composer, to say nothing of the complexity and opacity of the book’s overarching alchemical program.
        An alternative critical project might be to observe how <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>’ identity as a multimedia text
        depends as much on the <em>competition</em> that emerges among its visual, textual, musical, and chymical
        elements. The priorities of epigrammatic poetry, engraving, canonic counterpoint, and experimental chemistry
        cannot always be aligned, and many of the ludic qualities of Maier’s unique collection of emblems might be seen
        as epiphonema of the interpretive “noise” emitted by this competition. Such a reading would be attentive to the
        idiomatic—and idiosyncratic—priorities of each separate element before attempting to domesticate their details
        to their shared program or explain away the details that don’t seem to “fit.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Recovering Maier’s intentions for how the various elements of each emblem combine to reveal the “treasures here
        enclosed” may be beyond the reach of modern criticism, and attempting such a recovery may be beside the
        point.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Illicibus caperet,quae preciosa latent.” Maier, “Epigramma authoris,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [2].'>50</a></sup>
        Maier invited his readers, I believe, to seek their own meanings amid the rich and complex musical, textual,
        visual, and chymical interpretations that emerge with the thoughtful engagement of each element within each
        emblem and across the collection as a whole. Such engagement can take many forms, of course, from silent and
        solitary reading to convivial—perhaps even raucous—group play. In this context, Maier’s sly inclusion of
        Farmer’s canons cannot but underline the shared legacy of music and alchemy as social and embodied practices.

      <h2>Author Biography</h2>
      <p><strong>Loren Ludwig</strong> studied <em>viola da gamba</em> at Oberlin Conservatory and holds a Ph.D. in
        Critical and Comparative Studies in Music from the University of Virginia. He has taught at the Peabody
        Institute of Johns Hopkins University, Grinnell College, and the New Zealand School of Music. As a viol player,
        Loren performs widely as a soloist and chamber musician. He is a co-founder of critically acclaimed ensembles
        LeStrange Viols and ACRONYM. Current projects investigate the influences of Hermetic and Catholic esotericism in
        the history of early modern music theory, and the confluence of music and alchemy in seventeenth-century
        alchemical works by Michael Maier.
