        Mathematics, in several of its Renaissance guises, lies in the background throughout <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.
        In the preface, optics and music are among the “innumerable arts and sciences” the reader needs to search out
        God’s hidden secrets.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ad excolendum autem intellectum Deus infinita arcana abdidit in natura, quae scientiis et artibus innumeris, ut ignis ex silice extunduntur, et in usum transferuntur.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 6. This and all English translations from “Atalanta running,” Beinecke Library, unless otherwise noted.'>1</a></sup>
        Explaining <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="1">Emblem 1</a></span>, “Wind carried him in
        his belly,” Maier presents three examples of the mysterious “him”: in arithmetic it is the cubed root; in music,
        the perfect fifth; and in astronomy it is the center of the planets Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Portavit eum ventus in ventre suo.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 13. On page 14, Maier discusses the various meanings of what the wind carried.'>2</a></sup>
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="8">Emblem 8</a></span> uses the common technique of a
        perspective tunnel to focus the image. As a whole, the book is held together by music, as <span><a href="/essays/bianchi"
          target="_blank">Eric Bianchi</a></span> shows. Any Renaissance reader would have found these allusions to perspective,
        astronomy, and music instantly recognizable as “applied” or mixed sciences, rooted in the theoretical knowledge
        of arithmetic and geometry.

      <p>
        In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span> (<strong>fig. 1</strong>), mathematics
        moves into the foreground: “Make of the man and the woman a circle, of that a quadrangle, of this a triangle, of
        the same a circle, and you will have the Philosoph. Stone.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Face ex mare et foemina circulum, inde quadrangulum, hinc triangulum, fac circulum et habebis lap. Philosophorum.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 93.'>3</a></sup>
        The emblem itself comes from the influential <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em> (Rose garden of the philosophers;
        1550), in the chapter on conception by the alchemical king and queen.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='<em>Rosarium</em>, [29]v.'>4</a></sup> In the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, the emblem
        concludes a discussion of how substances mix and putrefy and their seeds begin to grow and transform: “Aristotle”
        presents the squaring of the circle to sum up the process known as conception. The dichotomy of male and female
        is a familiar piece in the metaphorical repertory of early modern alchemy.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Principe, “Revealing Analogies.”'>5</a></sup> Indeed, Emblem 21 here evokes themes that permeate <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> &mdash; the first two emblems play upon the male and female elements of the philosophers’ stone, its
        conception and generation, supplying the book with one of its governing metaphors. Nevertheless, Emblem 21 does not dwell on that rich dichotomy.
        Instead it spends most of its time on the ancient problem of squaring the circle. The epigram below the image
        underscores the explanatory power of mathematics, adding that “[i]f this [matter of conception] too high and too
        abstruse you find, / Geometry will soon inform your mind.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Si res tanta tuae non mox venit obvia menti, / Dogma Geometrae si capis, omne scies.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 93. The Beinecke translation underplays geometry’s promise; see the more literal translation at note 23 below. '>6</a></sup>

          <span class="caption">Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of
            constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Why should squaring the circle help understand nature’s secrets, even the philosophers’ stone? This essay takes up Maier’s injunction to consider how geometrical learning might support the alchemist, as part of Maier’s
        aim to present chymistry as serviceable to the state. By considering how <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span> redeploys commonplaces about the famous mathematical problem, I
        wish to suggest the ambivalence of mathematics as an archetypic form of innate knowledge and how this ambivalence could
        fuel a growing, fertile tension between learned and artisanal forms of knowledge.

        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span> uses mathematics to make a point
        about the possibility of transformation in knowledge. The accompanying discourse makes clear that the emblem is
        not intended to give advice on the actual process of refining the philosophers’ stone, as some of the other
        emblems are, such as those on the philosophers’ bath (e.g., <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="28">Emblem 28</a></span>). This holds true even near the end of the discourse, where Maier
        is most explicit about the emblem’s alchemical meaning. There he compares the transformation of a square into
        a circle to the conversion of inferior matter into the philosophers’ stone. Matter is a square, like the four
        elements, which metamorphoses through the three alchemical colors of earthy black, silvery white, and golden
        yellow, before ending up the final “invariable redness” (rubedo invariabilis) that characterizes the
        completed work. But what interests Maier is the metaphor of fertile conversion, as we see in an arithmetical
        metaphor for the same process: the resolution of the perfect number six into its divisors, ultimately into even
        and odd, until resolved into the unchanging divine One or Monad. The single sentence hints at the standard
        Pythagorean table of opposites, where even numbers are female, odd ones are male, and the One generates all
        numbers from within itself. As Maier forefronts the generation and transformation of these mathematical objects,
        the operational details fade. In the context of the alchemical work’s stage of conception, mathematics is a
        metaphor for fertility.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For other accounts of Emblem 21, see de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta Fugiens,”</em> 166–76; Böhme and Böhme, <em>Feuer, Wasser, Erde, Luft</em>, 250–54; Fankhauser, “Visuelle Erkenntnis”; Laube, “Bilder aus der Phiole,” 84–85; Chen-Morris, <em>Measuring Shadows</em>, 134–36. For some background on Pseudo-Lullian approaches to geometrical alchemy, see Ganzenmüller, <em>Die Alchemie</em>, 172–74.'>7</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the fertility of nature’s secret workings. Instead, Maier uses mathematics to consider the human
        mind’s power and its sources. Mathematics helps Maier think through a fundamental problem for any defender of a
        new science: how is human knowledge generated and transformed? Are human minds simply vessels for ideas they
        were born with, or do they generate and nurture new knowledge? Maier begins with a classic place in Plato, whose
        <em>Meno</em> used mathematics to supply the paradigmatic argument for all knowledge actually being remembered:
      </p>
      <div class="left-space">
        <p>
          [W]hich to prove, [Plato] introduces a youth yet very young, ignorant, and illiterate, whom he instructed
          first in geometrical interrogations so that the youth was observed to answer directly to all questions, and
          nolens volens, or without consideration to have attained to the very marrow of so intricate a Science.<sup><a
              href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Plato Philosophus illus . . . Quod ut probet, introducit puerum adhuc tenerum, rudem et literis incultum, cum quo ita interrogationes geometricas instituit, ut puer ad quaestiones omnes recte respondere animadvertatur, et nolens volensque sive inscius, in media tam arduae scientiae penetralia pervenisse.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 94.'>8</a></sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Mathematics supplied the strongest basis for the claim that minds do not change &mdash; they simply remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this account, knowledge is a gift, “whether . . . first taught by heaven, or by the Gods of the
        heathen.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Unde igitur scientiae et artes provenerunt, si homines non eas invenerint, an ex coelo vel a Diis gentium primitus traditae fuerunt, quaerent alii?” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 94.'>9</a></sup>
        To explore this idea, Maier uses the metaphor of fire: sparks and glowing coals evoke the flash of inspiration.
        This was a credible association for Renaissance thinkers, who might follow Marsilio Ficino in setting human intellectual
        power upon a Platonic footing, so that exceptional inventors of the arts and sciences might get their knowledge
        from ecstatic insight. But even though Maier accepts the image, he shifts the emphasis:
      </p>
      <div class="left-space">
        <p>
          It is one thing to say, that burning coals are covered under ashes in so great plenty, that if they may only
          appear by removing the ashes, they are sufficient to boil meat, or warm our cold limbs; it is another thing to
          affirm, that small sparks only do there lie hid, which, before they can be useful for boiling or warming, must
          by the industry, art, and care of man be stirred up, quickened, and nourished with fuel, otherwise they may
          easily be extinguished, and wholly reduced into cold ashes.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Respondeo, aliud est dicere sub cineribus tegi prunas ardentes tanta copia, ut si saltem, remotis cineribus proferantur, sufficiat at ciborum coctionem aut calefactionem frigidorum nostrorum artuum; aliud est affirmare saltem scintillas exiguas ibi latere, quae antequam sint usui ad coctionem aut calefactionem, industria, arte et cura humana fovendae, excolendae, et augendae sint suis fominibus &mdash; alias facile extingui posse, et in frigidos cineres totas redigi.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 94.'>10</a></sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Everyone has these “small sparks,” presumably given by God. But they must be cultivated. Nurture transforms such
        sparks into effective, useful knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an emphasis on human “industry, art, and care” opens up space for knowledge as the product of labor. Maier
        sets up a dichotomy between those faculties that Renaissance thinkers widely distrusted for being unreliable
        (imagination and phantasy; “imaginatio et phantasia”)  and those that might supply certain knowledge
        (reason and experience; “ratio et experientia”).  Moreover, Maier links the former to Plato and the
        latter to Aristotle. Imagination was known to concoct unreal links, being therefore an untrustworthy guide to
        reality; every practitioner of alchemy, in contrast, insisted that his craft was difficult and laborious, led by
        the twin guides of reason and experience.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        For someone like Maier, mathematics posed a peculiar challenge to reason and experience. Mathematics was
        associated with the opposite pole of remembered or inspired knowledge, not only because of Plato’s story of the
        untutored boy but also because of the special powers of music and mathematics to move the soul. Heinrich
        Khunrath’s famous image of the learned alchemist nods to such associations (<strong>fig. 2</strong>). The adept
        kneels in his tabernacle, praying before a <em>mise en abyme</em>: an open book just like Khunrath’s own, opened
        to the page that visually correlates the divine and material world in the shape of a triangle inscribed within
        a square within a circle.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        The image builds on the biblical story of young David’s harp and song driving out the wicked spirits of a
        melancholic King Saul and confirms commonplace tales about Pythagoras curing the Dionysiac madness of a youth
        with music. Such tales were recounted in handbooks on the liberal arts that introduced students to the rudiments
        of mathematical music theory.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On these commonplaces, see Hoffmann-Axthelm, “David Musicus.”'>15</a></sup>
        This iconography also deepened the link between mathematics and a knowledge sourced in ecstatic
        imagination &mdash; after all, imagination manipulates images, shapes. It can be no accident that Khunrath places the
        table of tools a short distance away from the forge, which is supported by the two prominent pillars of
        <em>ratio</em> and <em>experientia</em>. Arithmetic and geometry were widely reputed to be certain, yet they
        appear to support an account of knowledge depending on inspiration, or at least imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the discourse to <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span>, Maier solves
        this problematic association with inspiration by taking quadrature as a question of history. Squaring the circle is here an argument against
        Plato and for Aristotle. Plato said mathematical knowledge was remembered. Plato’s own student Aristotle,
        however, reported that the solution to the quadrature of the circle was not yet known &mdash; even though it was in
        principle knowable. “Whereupon it might be demanded, why Plato wrote upon the door of his school, that he that
        was ignorant of Geometry should not be admitted into it, he also having affirmed that children actually knew
        it?”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Unde quaeri posset, cur Plato suae scholae ostio inscripserit, Geometriae rudem in id non admitti, cum et puerulos eam actu scire affirmarit?” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 94.'>16</a></sup>
        In other words, if such knowledge is innate, surely Plato and his students would have known about the squaring
        of the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        To buttress his argument against Plato, Maier turns to the animal world, comparing a moth and a child. Most
        animals have instinct, he points out, and from birth they naturally know to avoid dangers. But humans are
        different. “An infant knows not or shuns such things, except hurt, or his finger being a little burnt at the
        flame of a candle like a Fire-fly [pyrausta], which burns its wings and falls down.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“infantem non sapere aut cavere talia, nisi laesum aut digito parum usto ad flammam candelae instar pyraustae, quae alas adurit et decidit?” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 95.'>17</a></sup>
        Here Maier deploys a proverb from the ancient Greek collection of Zenobius, popularized by Erasmus in Adage 851,
        on “the moth’s demise” (pyraustae interitus), a saying that applies to those who seek their own
        destruction just as a moth flies to the flame.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Erasmus, <em>Erasmi Opera omnia</em>, II.2, 372–73.'>18</a></sup> In emblem books of the
        sixteenth century, the proverbial moth was a well-known caution against dangerous innate tendencies &mdash; against the
        dangerous potential of one’s given character.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Hadrianus Junius alluded to this in his collection of emblems. Wesseling, “Devices, Proverbs, Emblems,” 233–39. On this terminology, see Marr et al., <em>Logodaedalus</em>.'>19</a></sup>
        Gabrieli Symeoni deployed the proverb in his own book of emblems: “just as the moth out of its nature
        [naturel], loving the brilliance of the fire in which it unwisely and knowingly is consumed, so he who
        too imprudently loves anything, gains only dishonor and misfortune.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Par le Papillon de son naturel, aimant la clarte du feu auquel indiscretement il se consomme peut estre entendu, celuy qui par trop imprudentement aimer quelque chose, saquiert deshonneur et dommage.” Symeoni, <em>Les divises</em>, 160v.'>20</a></sup>
        The inborn nature &mdash; the <em>ingenium</em> &mdash; of the moth compels it to self-destruction. To emphasize the tragic
        nature of the moth, Maier compares it with other insects. “Why do not the young bee, the fly and gnat fly
        directly into fire, they not knowing by experience the danger from thence arising?”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“cur apicula, musca, culex in ignem suo celerrimo volatu se non praecipitant?” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 95.'>21</a></sup>
        These other insects have self-preserving instincts, unlike the moth and unlike the helpless newborn human.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proverbial fact of the moth’s tragic <em>ingenium</em> allows Maier to say something about human knowledge,
        pushing back against the Platonist assumption that mathematics is innate. In fact, the quadrature of the circle
        is an example of knowledge that no one had in Plato’s time. “If Geometry be so natural and easy to children, how
        comes it to pass that the Square of a circle was not known to Plato himself, So that Aristotle the Scholar of
        Plato affirmed it possible to be known, but not as yet known?”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Si Geometria adeo naturalis et facilis est pueris, qui fit, quod ipsi Platoni quadratura circuli non innotuerit, adeo ut Aristoteles Platonis discipulus eam scibilem esse, ac necdum scitam affirmarit[?]” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 95.'>22</a></sup>
        The immediate implication is clear. The arts and sciences are not eternal verities, to be simply intuited or
        remembered. Even mathematics &mdash; the discipline most susceptible to that description &mdash; changes and develops with time.
        Therefore, space must be made for new forms of knowledge. Squaring the circle becomes an example of how unknown
        disciplines can legitimately be developed through <em>ratio et experientia</em>.

        The transformation of knowledge does not happen overnight. Epigram 21 also alludes to the time it may take for a
        new discipline to emerge, when translated most literally: “If such a great matter does not quickly come to mind,
        if you take up the teaching of geometry, you will know all.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Si res tanta tuae non mox venit obvia menti, / Dogma Geometrae si capis, omne scies.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 93. Cf. the Beinecke translation at note 6 above.'>23</a></sup>
        Patience is required. Maier confidently assumes his reader will agree that geometry &mdash; and specifically the
        geometry of circle squaring &mdash; will repay patience. To understand this confidence, we need to consider the status
        of quadrature of the circle in early modern mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the moth and the flame, “squaring the circle” has become a modern proverb for quixotic attempts of human
        knowledge that are doomed to fail. We have known since the 1890s that a solution is formally impossible. Earlier
        in the nineteenth century, Augustus de Morgan already cast the circle-squarer as the archetype of thinkers lured
        to foolish, wasted study on unsolvable paradoxes such as perpetual motion machines.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='De Morgan, <em>Budget of Paradoxes</em>, which draws also on Montucla, <em>Recherches sur la quadrature</em>. See further Rudio, <em>Über die Kreismessung</em>.'>24</a></sup>
        Yet de Morgan satirized circle-squarers even while producing a ream of notes on the history of the problem &mdash; a
        history that revealed squaring the circle as a legitimate problem that had exercised the best mathematical minds
        since antiquity, along with problems such as duplicating the cube or trisecting an angle. The challenge was not
        to find a close approximation between a circle and a square but rather to prove an exact equivalence, using
        only Euclidean principles, a compass, and a straightedge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Maier’s time, squaring the circle was not a species of learned folly but precisely the opposite: it was the
        archetype of knowledge that was <em>possible</em> but not yet possessed. Every university student knew this from
        Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>, which had been used since antiquity to introduce students to the basics of
        logic. To argue that an object of knowledge exists even when no one knows of it (a tree falls in the forest even
        if nobody hears), Aristotle used quadrature as his evidence. “Take the squaring of the circle, for instance, if
        that can be called such object. Although it exists as an object, the knowledge does not yet exist.”<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Aristotle, <em>Categories</em> 7 (7b30–33).'>25</a></sup>
        Aristotle set the quadrature as a central problem for Renaissance mathematicians. He also gave them examples of
        how his own contemporaries had failed. In his <em>Physics</em>, he sketched three attempts, one by Bryson, another by
        Antiphon, and the fullest by Hippocrates of Chios.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Aristotle, <em>Physics</em> 1.2 (185a14-17). For other places in Aristotle, see Heath, <em>Mathematics in Aristotle</em>, 47–48, 93–97.'>26</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, Aristotle’s statements about quadrature were widely familiar to members of the republic of learning.
        When Nicholas of Cusa described his own attempt, he described it as a topic for learned conversation, in
        Aristotle’s language of knowability.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Although higher philosophy and public service had called me away for some time from the study of geometry, still, among the innumerable important responsibilities of a papal legation, the claim that the quadrature of the circle is knowable but not known, delightfully found its way into the conversations of scholars” (Quamvis iam dudum a studio Geometrico nos altior speculatio ac publica retraxerit utilitas, tamen inter innumeras seriosas curas, quas habet apostolica legatio, se inter colloquia studiosorum delectabiliter immiscuit, de quadratura circuli scibili et non scita assertio). Cusanus, <em>De quadratura circuli</em>, 5, quoted and translated in Goulding, “Studies,” 169. Standard handbooks on logic commented on this passage: for example, Lefèvre d’Étaples discussed Cusanus’s effort in his <em>Libri logicorum</em>, 33r.'>27</a></sup>
        Oronce Fine opened his attempt at a solution with a discussion of Aristotle’s statements on the topic; having
        given his subject an august history, from Aristotle and Archimedes to Cusanus, he demurred that he would hardly
        be worthy of his office if, as royal professor of mathematics, he left quadrature aside. A high-water mark was
        reached by Fine’s student Jean Borrel (Buteo), whose <em>De quadratura circuli</em> (On squaring the circle;
        1559) based its critical reading of the problem on a step-by-step reconstruction of Bryson, Antiphon, and
        Hippocrates, out of Aristotle, before moving on to an analysis of the modern failures of Cusanus, Fine, and
        others.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='A very different work, but similarly attentive to Aristotle’s comments on quadrature, is Pietro Catena, <em>Universa loca in logicam Aristotelis, in mathematicas disciplinas</em> (Venice: Francisco Marcolino, 1556).'>28</a></sup>
        Borrel’s book served as a manual for would-be circle-squarers, as well as a cautionary tale.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a whole, the history of quadrature is one of failure, of ingenious solutions followed by ever sharper
        analysis and critique. Some of the more spectacular failures involved the tallest intellectual giants of the
        day. Maier and indeed the whole learned world heard about Julius Caesar Scaliger, who deigned to turn his
        princely expertise in philology to expurgate the errors of mere mathematicians. But his gorgeously printed
        <em>Cyclometria</em> (Measurement of the circle) revealed his own fundamental errors of mathematical judgment,
        and mathematicians all over Europe darted at the great man’s exposed flank. Christoph Clavius penned the most
        widely read refutation, though rumors circulated also that formidable mathematicians such as Henry Savile found
        Scaliger’s quadrature nonsense.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Goulding, “Polemic in the Margin,” 241–59.'>29</a></sup> Over half a century later,
        Thomas Hobbes would play from the same script, convinced like Scaliger that his towering intellect would finally
        realize the possibility Aristotle had mentioned &mdash; only to be disabused of his mathematical prowess by the Oxford
        Savilian professor John Wallis.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Jesseph, <em>Squaring the Circle</em>. For later seventeenth century works on quadrature as an activity especially suited to the Habsburg court, see Ashworth, "The Habsburg Circle." (Thanks to Simon Schaffer for this reference.)'>30</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet spectacular failures did not eliminate hope that the circle might be squared. The very hubris of Scaliger
        and Hobbes in taking on quadrature indicates their high regard for the problem as the gold standard for the
        possibility of new knowledge.

        Precisely because it was <em>the</em> reputable example of knowledge that was possible but not yet possessed,
        the squaring of the circle could legitimate the kind of new knowledge Maier proposed. Recall the tenor of his
        argument: that “reason and experience” are the way forward in developing new knowledge; and that, contrary to
        what the Platonists might say, mathematics is evidence for the productivity of reason and experience. Near the
        end of the discourse, however, Maier’s argument moves from the lofty eminences of philosophy, Plato and
        Aristotle, to practical mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money and politics were certainly on Maier’s mind. He had lost a powerful patron in 1612 when Rudolf II died, and afterward he began traveling Europe and writing in search of a new one. After time in Rotterdam and London, he settled in
        Frankfurt am Main. In the two years leading up to the publication of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> early in 1618,
        Maier had written several “chemical tracts” while he lay ill, including a <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>
        (On the natural [or: physical] circle squared; 1616), dedicated to Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, a prince widely known
        for his alchemical interests.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Moran, <em>Alchemical World</em>.'>31</a></sup> In April 1618, the ink on <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em> barely dry, Maier sent it along with ten of his other books to the prince and was promptly
        appointed <em>Medicus und Chymicus von Hauß aus</em> (court physician and chymist).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Figala and Neumann, “New Light,” 135.'>32</a></sup> The books had achieved their
        main goal of catching the count’s eye. Maier himself later admitted these books were meant to gain
        attention &mdash; indeed to sell, as they were “inspired more by the small payment which I received for them rather than
        by the improvement and perfection of the works themselves.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“lucella, quod inde evenit, magis incitatus, quam maturitate et emendatione ipsorum opusculorum.” Quoted in Tilton, <em>Quest for the Phoenix</em>, 131.'>33</a></sup>
        The contents of <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em> in no way attempted to contribute to the mathematical
        scholarship on quadrature. It developed a reflection on the “circular” motions of the natural four elements,
        which tend ultimately to circular perfection, in the heavens, on earth, and also in human hearts. The book
        culminated in reflections on the prince as the heart of his people, the center who unified disparate members
        within the political ambit.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='E.g., Maier, <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, 70.'>34</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier opened <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em> with a familiar hook in the first sentence of the dedication:
      </p>
      <div class="left-space">
        <p>
          Aristotle claimed that in his time, most illustrious prince, the quadrature of the circle was not known,
          though knowable. After him many &mdash; too quickly shouting that Archimidean phrase “<em>eureka,
            eureka</em>” &mdash; proclaim that they have discovered it, while others say something else. Most only deal only
          with geometrical subjects, while few deal with subjects that look not so much to mathematics as to physical
          matter, such as natural bodies.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Circuli quadraturam, Illustrissime PRINCEPS, Aristoteles suo tempore non scitam, at scibilem pronunciavit. Post eum non pauci Archimideum illud <em>eureka, eureka</em> nimis praepropere cantantes sese invenisse proclamarunt, at alii in alia forma: Plurimi in Geometricis solis, nonnulli in subiectis non tam ad mathesin quam physicam spectantibus, ut sunt corpora naturalia.” Maier, <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, 3.'>35</a></sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Thankfully, Maier was available to ensure that the prince would have the chemical, medical, and indeed moral
        knowledge he needed to care for his subjects. Squaring the circle &mdash; or at least the “physical circle” &mdash; was a matter
        of state utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the discourse attached to <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem
            21</a></span> of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, Maier is concerned with practical knowledge; the “sparks
        of inspiration” resolve in a cooking analogy, where the flame serves digestion and the cook’s tasks. Near the
        end of the discourse he assures the reader that he intends something much more useful than the mathematicians
        can give: “Now that this quadration is Physical and agreeable to nature, every man understands; by which far
        more utility accrues to a Commonwealth as also more illustration to the mind of man, than by that Mathematical
        and merely theoretical or from an abstracted matter.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Quadrationem autem hanc esse physicam et naturae convenientem, quilibet intelligit. Ex qua longe plus utilitatis ad Rempub. ut et plus illustrationis ad humanam mentem pervenit, quam ex illa mathematica et mere theorica seu a materia abstracta.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 95.'>36</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Maier takes this argument one step further, tying <em>successful</em> quadrature to practical utility. Not
        only is squaring the circle possible, but it has in fact been done by those with practical wit. After promising
        all manner of utility to the commonweal, he says, “To learn that perfectly, a Geometrician acting about
        solid bodies must inquire what depth of Solid figures, for example, of Sphere and Cube can be known, and
        transferred to manual use or practice.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Illa addiscatur, Geometram de solidis corporibus agentem oportet investigare, quae figurarum solidarum, exempli gratia, Sphaerae et Cubi profunditas agnoscatur et ad usum seu praxin manualem transferatur.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 95.'>37</a></sup>
        What follows is a garbled example of practical mathematics, using a rule of thumb to approximate the size of a
        cube of the same area as a given sphere. By the time Maier has moved on to say that chymical philosophers’ work
        does the same thing, the point has been made: in fact, people do cube spheres, which shows the power of
        practice. Just as mathematical quadrature has actually been found by artisans who measure columns, dig wells,
        and gauge barrels, so too actually letting alchemists get on with their practice will result in new, useful
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier here makes a point every circle-squarer knew &mdash; and struggled mightily to avoid. Craftsmen had always used
        rules of thumb for the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius (π = approx. 22/7) to convert circles to
        squares. Some theorists, such as Campanus, Nicholas of Cusa, and Charles de Bovelles, tried to formalize these
        techniques.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Montucla, <em>Histoire de recherches</em>, 202–3.'>38</a></sup> Theorists often ridiculed
        such practical efforts as formally fallacious. Nevertheless, they could hardly forget their existence. It was
        common knowledge that an approximation can get arbitrarily close to success; the challenge is to make it perfect,
        within the self-imposed framework of Euclidean demonstration. It is perfectly possible to square the circle in a
        way that “satisfies the senses,” as Jakob Christmann put it.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Christmann, <em>Tractatio geometrica</em>, 9–10. See Goulding, “Studies,” 174.'>39</a></sup>
        Because such solutions, even though off limits in theory, are rather well suited to experience, the problem
        taunts. Common intuition is precisely what makes the problem alluring.

        Pragmatic accounts of the untutored mind’s success seem to have inflated the value of quadrature among the likes
        of Maier. For Maier, with his rhetoric of utility, must be seen as part of a larger group of projectors who
        stoked the desires of funders with wish lists, accounts of desiderata in knowledge that promised outstanding
        utility to princes and governors.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Keller, <em>Knowledge</em>.'>40</a></sup> The genre’s founder, the Paduan law professor
        Guido Pancirolli, included the quadrature in his <em>Nova reperta sive Rerum memorabilium, recens inventarum, et veteribus plane incognitarum</em> (Two books of things lost and newly
        found) &mdash; he offered a solution using mechanicians’ rules of thumb.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Pancirolli and Salmuth. <em>Nova reperta</em>, 656–59. On Pancirolli’s project, see Keller, “Accounting for Invention.”'>41</a></sup>
        His student Heinrich Salmuth set Pancirolli’s solution within the long history of mathematical solutions, from
        Antiphon and Brysson to Cusanus and Borrel. But his last two authorities were particularly telling: Peter Ramus
        and Jakob Christmann.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Pancirolli and Salmuth, <em>Nova reperta</em>, 659–64.'>42</a></sup> Both had reflected
        upon how artisans had been able to satisfy the senses “honestly” (ingenue).<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='E.g., Christmann: “Tolerandi igitur sunt huiusmodi artifices, qui circuli quadraturam, ex rationibus mechanicis constructam, sensibus aliquo usque satisfacere ingenue profitentur.” <em>Tractatio geometrica</em>, 9–10.'>43</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Quadrature was prominent on the lists of seventeenth-century utopian thinkers, who hoped to regain for mankind
        the knowledge lost after the Fall into sin.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Dickson, <em>Tessera of Antilia</em>; Harrison, <em>Fall of Man</em>.'>44</a></sup>
        In his <em>Mythologiae Christianae</em> (Christian mythology), Johann Valentin Andreae, the Lutheran theologian who like Maier contributed to the early swell of Rosicrucian
        tracts, surveyed a fabulous marketplace
        filled with desirable knowledge from the art of memory to the quintessence. Andreae’s survey of the marketplace
        began with the quadrature of the circle.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Andreae, <em>Mythologiae Christianae</em>, 259–60.'>45</a></sup> Jakob Bornitz, a
        politician who was connected to Maier’s circles through the Rudolphine court, likewise included quadrature on
        his list of things to be rediscovered and investigated, next to perpetual fire and techniques for navigating
        against the wind and under water.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Bornitz, <em>Tractatus politicus</em>, 227.'>46</a></sup> Bornitz’s list was influential:
        it was excerpted by the well-connected Samuel Hartlib into his own <em>Ephemerides</em>, as well as by the
        pedagogical reformer Jan Amos Comenius.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Keller, <em>Knowledge</em>, 172–81.'>47</a></sup> These projects used squaring the circle
        as an intellectual desideratum in ways similar to Maier’s. Bornitz himself cited Scaliger to support the
        worthiness of quadrature as a pursuit, but he also referenced two less-learned examples. The Leiden mathematical
        teacher Ludolph van Ceulen, teacher to Willebrord Snell, wrote a study of quadrature which refined the practical
        method for approximating quadrature to the limit of the senses.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='van Ceulen, <em>De circulo</em>.'>48</a></sup> Bornitz also cited an even more telling
        work from his and Maier’s own circles: the painter Philipp Uffenbach, who wrote a work on quadrature that
        celebrated the use of instruments beyond the compass and straightedge to offer a “new, short, extremely useful,
        and effortless mechanical treatise and account.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Uffenbach, <em>De quadratura circuli mechanici</em>.'>49</a></sup> Such works contravened
        theoretical rules but vindicated Maier’s promises at two levels. They played on learned assumptions about
        possible knowledge; they also fostered a growing assumption that letting artisans get on with it would bring
        such knowledge about.

        This was polemic, of course, defending the associations of <em>chymia</em> with grubby labor. Maier had used
        quadrature to show the balance required between innate talent and cunning industry. Certainly, witless labor was
        no answer. At the end of <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, in some <em>Cantilena Acreontica</em>
        (Anacreontic songs), Maier excoriated rivals for being entirely without inspired talent or acquired skill. The
        Ancreontic genre offered a chance to play with the themes of inspiration, wine, and sensory pleasure.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='This was the association after Henri Estienne’s edition of poems that he mistakenly attributed to the Greek master Anacreon: Estienne, <em>Anacreontis Teii odae</em>.'>50</a></sup>
        These “stumbling verses” (claudicanta camaena) deride those who only think of vital powers lying in
        “smelly filth, and the limbs of animals” and not “in the metals dug from the deep hollows of the earth”; such
        people are “led by ignorance and madness of the mind.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Nec cessat illa gratas nobis locare vires / In faetidis oletis, membrisque bestiarum; / Imo nec in lapillis, rivis aquae petitis, / Nec erutis profundo terrae sinu METALLIS. / Quod si furore mentis inscitiaque ductus / Negabit haec, et illa concedet, anne iniquus.” Maier, <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, 76. For commentary, see Leibenguth, <em>Hermetische Poesie</em>, 432.'>51</a></sup>
        Ultimately, Maier associates such people with a certain naïveté:
      </p>
      <div class="left-space">
        <p>
          For the purest metals are enclosed in hard clay, lest anyone still fast asleep or with hands yet unhardened by
          labor should try to get them out: lest he should burst the gate from its hinges &mdash; that fat, common day-laborer,
          who has not even a little of the saltcellar, of wit, of craft, of learning &mdash; lest any scoundrel or thief enter
          the holy places.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“Nam sunt metalla duris perfectiora testis / Inclusa, ne quis alto sopore pressus illa / Enucleat, tenella cui sint manus labore: / Ne claustra tam arcta rumpat compagibus solutis / Ex plebe cerdo crassus, cui nil adest salilli, / Vel ingeni, vel artis, vel eruditionis: / Praedator ullus aut fur ad tanta sacra ne intret.” Maier, <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em>, 77.'>52</a></sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Despite his praise for practice, Maier intended to eliminate neither class nor talent. One needed at least a
        spark of inborn wit to go with industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maier offers us a way to reconsider the usual dichotomies we use to understand early modern knowledge. The usual
        dichotomy is drawn between Descartes and Bacon: between rationalism and experimentalism, between reason and
        experience. But Maier &mdash; and the network of mathematicians, alchemists, and projectors who made up his world &mdash; drew
        the dichotomy differently. He was eager to claim <em>ratio et experientia</em> together as a pleonasm for
        chymistry; their contrast was innate knowledge, inspiration. An option was to put mathematics on the innate side
        of the ledger, aligning reason, imagination, and memory with the certainty of mathematical proof. Instead, Maier
        pushed for a vision of the human mind that admitted the origins of knowledge somehow in sparks of divinity &mdash; but
        to be useful, productive, these must be developed by reason and experience. On his retelling, mathematics became
        evidence that instinct was not enough but must be nurtured through reason and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we see this formulation in Maier, we can begin to see its significance elsewhere. Around the time that
        Maier was writing <em>De circulo physico quadrato</em> and <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, René Descartes was
        beginning his own study of mathematical learning, but with very different effects. For a brief while, Descartes
        was intrigued by Rosicrucian themes. In 1619, during his time in Germany, he wrote his old teacher Isaac
        Beeckman, asking after the art of Lull.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On this period of Descartes’s life, see Mehl, <em>Descartes en Allemagne</em>.'>53</a></sup>
        When he returned to Paris in 1623, he found himself under suspicion of being a member of the Rosicrucian
        brotherhood &mdash; a suspicion that reemerged later in the century.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Shea, <em>Magic of Numbers</em>, 93–120.'>54</a></sup> What he shared with Maier and
        others linked to the Rosicrucian circles was a conviction in the need to develop one’s inborn talent. A famous
        passage in Descartes’s early <em>Regulae ad directionem ingenium</em> (Rules for the direction of the mind)
        reflects on the origins of knowledge in terms akin to those Maier used in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span>:
      </p>
      <div class="left-space">
        <p>
          I can readily believe that the great minds of the past were to some extent aware of it, guided even by nature
          alone. For the human mind has within it a sort of spark of the divine, in which the first seeds of useful ways
          of thinking are sown, seeds which, however neglected and stifled by studies which impede them, often bear
          fruit of their own accord.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='Descartes, <em>Regulae</em>, in Cottingham et al., <em>Philosophical Writings</em>, 1:17 (Adam and Tannery, <em>Oeuvres</em>, 10:373).'>55</a></sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The goal of the <em>Regulae</em> would have been quite familiar to Maier: to provide the reason and experience
        needed to develop the inborn light, seeds, or mind (<em>lumen, semina, ingenium</em>). But the two differed in
        their evaluation of whether mathematical reasoning might itself be reason and experience. Descartes took the old
        bedrock disciplines, geometry and arithmetic, and transformed their exercise into a method for all the arts &mdash; what
        he called a <em>mathesis universalis</em>.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, e.g., Rabouin, <em>Mathesis universalis</em>.'>56</a></sup> Maier instead kept
        mathematics fixed within the cycle of arts, as a rhetorical and historical metaphor of transformation &mdash; leaving
        reason and experience to work without mathematics at the furnace.
