        Michael Maier’s <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (1618) offers a heady mix of arcane alchemical principles, humanist
        literary references, and contrapuntal fugues, but it is the volume’s striking copper-plate etchings that are
        most likely to retain a vivid presence in the reader’s imagination long after the book is closed. Composed of
        elegantly-rendered figural groups typically set within mountainous landscapes that sometimes make direct
        reference to the German lands in which the book was produced, the etchings offer visual interpretations of the
        cryptic mottos that accompany each of the volume’s fifty emblems. The quality of these pictures, perhaps more
        than any other aspect of this notable publication, has secured its place of distinction in the alchemical
        literature of early modern Europe. While the figural compositions undoubtedly were influenced by Maier, who took
        inspiration from numerous textual and pictorial sources, the actual plates are the work of the de Bry book
        publishing firm in Oppenheim.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the sources for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, see de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta Fugiens</em>.” De Jong’s concern is primarily with textual sources for the emblems rather than visual sources.'>1</a></sup>
        It is appropriate to begin, therefore, with a consideration of this family’s pictorial contribution to
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1588, Theodor de Bry and his sons, Johann Theodor and Johann Israel, having fled the southern Netherlands as
        Calvinist exiles, arrived in the free imperial city of Frankfurt am Main, where they quickly established a
        reputation as engravers and publishers of high-quality illustrated books. The de Bry family was best known for
        its two series of illustrated travel accounts, the <em>India occidentalis</em> (West Indies, 1590–1634) and the
        <em>India orientalis</em> (East Indies, 1597–1628). In his engraved self-portrait of 1615, Johann Theodor, who
        oversaw these long-term projects after the deaths of his father and brother, stands proudly before two stacks of
        pages labeled with the titles of these collections (<strong>fig. 1</strong>). But the engraved plate that he
        props up with his left hand on top of the stacks, with its vanitas image and the motto “Quis Evadet” [Who will
        be spared?], highlights the emblematic publications that were also an important part of his firm’s
        repertoire.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='For a full list of the publications of the de Bry firm, see van Groesen, <em>Overseas World</em>, 389–491. The emblem in the self-portrait is a widely copied design by Hendrick Goltzius. See Leeflang, <em>Dutch & Flemish Etchings</em>, 218–21, catalog no. 529.'>2</a></sup>

      <p>
        The alchemical emblems of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> belong to a period of extraordinary productivity between
        1609 and 1620 during which Johann Theodor relocated the firm to the Palatinate town of Oppenheim and published
        the profusely illustrated alchemical works of Maier and the English Hermetic philosopher Robert Fludd. Unlike
        Frankfurt, which showed wavering support for its community of Reformed exiles, the Calvinist state of the
        Palatinate under the Elector Palatine, Frederick V, provided a liberal religious and intellectual climate that
        promoted the publishing of works of alchemical and occult interest and, as Frances Yates has shown, allowed for
        the flourishing of a “Rosicrucian Enlightenment.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Yates, <em>Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>.'>3</a></sup> Johann Theodor de Bry, a shrewd
        businessman, took advantage of these conditions until 1620, when the onset of the Thirty Years War forced him to
        return to Frankfurt.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the de Bry firm’s publishing activities in Oppenheim, see Yates, <em>Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>, 70–90; and van Groesen, <em>Overseas World</em>, 90–98.'>4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        During its busy years in Oppenheim, the de Bry firm was fortunate to add a talented and productive member to the
        family, Matthäus Merian, who in February 1617 married Johan Theodor’s daughter, Maria Magdalena de Bry. Merian
        was a native of Basel who learned the technique of etching during his apprenticeship in Zurich and refined his
        skills in Strasbourg, Nancy, and Paris before arriving in Oppenheim.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On Merian’s life, see Wüthrich, <em>Matthäus Merian</em>.'>5</a></sup> Etching requires
        the artist to draw a design with a pointed stylus, or “needle,” directly on a copper plate that has been covered
        with an acid-resistant ground. When the plate is then submerged in acid, the exposed lines are etched into the
        plate so they can hold ink for printing. Etching is the closest of the printmaking processes to pen-and-ink
        drawing and is carried out much more quickly than engraving, a laborious process in which the artist uses the
        palm of his hand to push the point of a burin—the tool held in Johann Theodor’s left hand in his
        self-portrait—into the copper plate. As an etcher, Merian was better-suited to meeting heavy demands for
        illustrations than was his father-in-law, to whom no known etchings have been attributed.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Wüthrich, <em>Matthäus Merian</em>, 87.'>6</a></sup> Although no artist
        is named on the title page of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> or on that of Fludd’s magnum opus, the <em>Utriusque
          cosmi</em> [. . .] <em>historia</em> (The History of the Macrocosm and Microcosm, 1617–1621), we can safely
        attribute the etched plates in both publications to Merian.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='It is widely accepted that Merian was responsible for Maier’s and many of Fludd’s plates, including by Merian’s biographer Wüthrich, who treats the etchings for Maier and Fludd at length: see Wüthrich, <em>Matthäus Merian</em>, 214–32. One exception to this viewpoint is Stanislas Klossowski de Rola, who argues that the plates of <em>Atlanta fugiens</em> “were definitely engraved by Johann Theodor de Bry and not, as has been erroneously suggested in recent years, by Matthäus Merian,” although he provides no evidence as to why we should accept this assertion. Klossowski de Rola, <em>Golden Game</em>, 68.'>7</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Merian not only brought expertise in etching to the de Bry firm; he brought expertise in landscape
        representation as well, and indeed his reputation as a printmaker rests largely on his views of European cities
        and their surroundings. Etching and landscape had been closely linked since both appeared on the scene during
        the first half of the sixteenth century. Some of the earliest German artists to develop the genre of independent
        landscape, including Albrecht Altdorfer and Augustin Hirschvogel, recognized the possibilities of the new
        printmaking process for translating their distinctive landscape drawing styles into a reproductive
        medium.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Wood, <em>Albrecht Altdorfer</em>, 246–66; and Landau and Parshall, <em>Renaissance Print</em>, 342–47.'>8</a></sup>
        And landscape remained an important subject for northern European etchers of the seventeenth century like Merian
        and his Dutch contemporary Claes Jansz. Visscher. In the contents page to Visscher’s series of topographical
        landscapes, <em>Pleasant Places</em> (1611), an architectural frame surrounds an appealing view of a lighthouse
        in the dunes outside Haarlem. Before our eyes can take in this landscape, however, they are confronted with the
        etcher’s needles, bottles of mordant, and copper plate, all of which rest on the sill of the frame (<strong>fig.
          2</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On Visscher’s <em>Pleasant Places</em> see Gibson, <em>Pleasant Places</em>; and Levesque, <em>Journey Through Landscape</em>, 35–54.'>9</a></sup>
        Etching, Visscher’s print suggests, makes it possible to preserve the vividness of the artist’s own direct
        experience of nature in a reproduction. An accomplished topographical etcher, Merian lavished an unusual
        attention on landscape in the emblems for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Approaching these pictures through their
        landscapes can offer fresh insight into this artist’s unique contribution to alchemical imagery.

        Before proceeding into the background, however, it seems appropriate to make our entry into Merian’s pictures
        through the emblem in the foreground. Emblematics was another genre in which Merian was prolific. His earliest
        emblems date to 1614 when, in Paris, he created twelve plates for the <em>Emblemata amatoria</em> (Emblems of
        Love), and he continued to be active in this field throughout his career. Among his best-known endeavors are the
        fifty etchings for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, and one hundred moral and political emblems for Julius Wilhelm
        Zincgref’s <em>Emblematum ethico-politicorum centuria</em> (One Hundred Ethical-Political Emblems, 1619), the
        most celebrated German emblem book of the seventeenth century and also the first publication from the de Bry
        firm to include Merian’s name on its title page.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the <em>Emblemata amatoria</em>, see Wüthrich, <em>Das druckgraphische</em> werk, vol. 1, xii; on the <em>Emblematum ethico-politicorum centuria</em>, see Wüthrich, <em>Matthäus Merian</em>, 246–49.'>10</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The emblem has its origins in the ancient literary genre of the epigram, but its typical early modern format was
        established with the publication of Andrea Alciato’s <em>Emblematum liber</em> (Book of Emblems) in 1531.
        Alciato’s book made the interpretation of the epigram into a witty and learned game by appending to it a brief
        motto and a picture, inviting the reader to engage in the pleasurable task of decoding hidden meanings by
        considering all three parts together. Maier, who adds a musical component and a prose commentary to Alciato’s
        tripartite scheme, tells us on the title page of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> that his emblems are “not without
        Singular delectation, to be seen, read, meditated, Understood, distinguished, Sung and Heard.”<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“ . . . non absq[ue] singulari iucunditate videnda, legenda, meditanda, intelligenda, diiudicanda, canenda & audienda.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, [1]. This and all English translations from <em>Atalanta running</em>, Beinecke Library, unless otherwise noted.'>11</a></sup>
        The emblem is, from a modern viewpoint, inherently interdisciplinary, and for this reason it would be
        inappropriate to isolate any one part of it for specialized analysis. Its meanings can be found only in the
        relationship between its parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the baroque world of emblematics, all things are linked through chains of resemblance that bind together the
        mundane and spiritual realms.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The scholarly literature on emblems is vast. Foundational works include Praz, <em>Seventeenth-Century Imagery</em>; Freeman, <em>English Emblem Books</em>; and Daly, <em>Literature in Light</em>.'>12</a></sup>
        While emblems often have a strong “natural history” component, for example, an animal present in an emblem is
        never to be understood as a member of a particular species, but through the moral, humoral, and philological
        associations it has acquired over time.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See Ashworth, “Natural History.”'>13</a></sup> The salamander, which is pictured in
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="29">Emblem 29</a></span> of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, was
        reported to survive in fire by various ancient authorities including Aristotle, Pliny, and Avicenna, the last of
        whom is the source of Maier’s motto, “As the Salamander lives in fire so also the Stone” (<strong>fig.
          3</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Ut Salamandra vivit igne sic lapis.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 125.'>14</a></sup>
        In Merian’s picture, a salamander with a row of stars across its back (a feature described by Pliny) crouches
        cat-like amidst the flames while turning its head into the billowing smoke, seemingly unharmed by the
        fire.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Pliny describes the salamander as <em>stellatum</em>. Pliny, <em>Natural History</em>, 412. Woodcut illustrations of the salamander with stars on its back can be found in von Breydenbach, <em>Peregrinatio</em>, and Gesner, <em>Icones animalivm</em>, 119.'>15</a></sup>
        As with a biblical parable, however, a literal reading of the picture is insufficient: one must see through the
        outward form in order to discover a macrocosmic significance. Maier helps us to do so not only with references
        to the <em>lapis</em> [stone] in his motto and epigram, but by explaining in his commentary that the
        “philosophical salamander” (i.e., the philosophers’ stone) resembles the common salamander in its imperviousness
        to fire.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Maier’s courtly, humanistic brand of alchemy lent itself to emblematic thinking. Just as he sought to transform
        the soul through the skilled and learned manipulation of sensible matter, so his emblems promise to reveal the
        deepest secrets of nature through their appeal to the senses. In his preface, Maier declares that if his book
        seems
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          more intellectual, than sensual, the more profitable and delightful will it be in time: but if it be first in
          bondage to the sense, there is no doubt but there will be a passage from the sense to the understanding as by
          a door: for nothing is said to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense, the
          understanding of a man new born being supposed as a smooth table, wherein nothing is as yet written, but any
          thing may be written by the help of sense, as a Styl[us].<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='“ . . . si potius intellectualis fuerit, quam sensualis, eo utilior & iucundior olim futurus est: quod si vero primum sensui mancipatus, nullum est dubium quin a sensu ad intellectum transitus fiet, tamquam per ostium: Nihil enim in intellectu esse dicitur, quod non per sensum aliquem introiverit, cum hominis recens nati intellectus instar tabulae rasae habeatur, in qua nihil adhuc- scriptum, sed quod libet sensu mediante, tanquam stylo, scribe possit.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 8–9.'>17</a></sup>

      <p>
        For Maier, the senses are clearly indispensable to the pursuit of alchemical understanding, yet like Aristotle
        to whom he alludes in the above passage, he also insists on a hierarchy of knowledge. The “common salamander”
        pictured in Merian’s etching may resemble the “philosophical salamander” of the intellect, but the difference
        between the two is equally important: while the common salamander is said to withstand the fire because of its
        cold and wet nature, in the ideal salamander all the elements are perfectly balanced.<sup><a href="#"

        engages our senses, but it does so in order to disconnect us from a merely corporeal experience of a fallen and
        corrupt world, setting us down a symbolic pathway toward the retrieval of universal concepts hidden in
        nature.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Maier’s Aristotelian stylus for writing these concepts on the blank tablet of the reader’s intellect was
        Merian’s etching needle, and the collaboration between the two men resulted in an extraordinarily rich and

        Merian’s picture features a nude man with the face of the sun, a nude woman with the face of the moon, and a
        cock and hen at their feet. The content is simple, but also full of symbolic resonance within the alchemical
        tradition. The sun represents hot and dry sulfur, the moon cold and moist mercury; and just “as the cock is
        desired by the hen,” the epigram informs us, so the moon needs the sun for their philosophical union.<sup><a

            data-text-content='“ . . . gallinae gallus ut expetitur.” Maier, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 129. My translation.'>21</a></sup>
        The source for the motto and image is an alchemical text that Maier knew well, the <em>Rosarium
          philosophorum</em> (Rose Garden of the Philosophers), a work culled from various medieval sources and
        published in a Frankfurt edition in 1550 with woodcuts.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='The <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em> was published as one part of a larger compendium entitled <em>De alchimia opuscula complura veterum philosophorum</em> [. . .] (Little Works on Alchemy from Many Ancient Philosophers, Frankfurt, 1550).'>22</a></sup>
        In one of its images, a nude king and queen stand upon the sun and moon, offering one another flowers, declaring
        their marriage, and united by a dove signifying the life-giving spirit (<strong>fig. 5</strong>). Merian
        transforms his model by fusing the human figures with their chemical symbols, thus personifying the gendered
        elements of sulfur and mercury, and by adding a new layer of meaning with the cock and hen. The result is an
        image that is concise in its expression and multi-layered in its symbolism. It is one of several plates in
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> that are derived, to different degrees, from the woodcuts of the <em>Rosarium
          philosophorum</em>.

      <p>
        By no means, however, do all of the pictures in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> originate in alchemical sources, as we
        see in the case of the Old Testament figure of Naaman, the subject of <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="13">Emblem 13</a></span> (<strong>fig. 6</strong>). Naaman, commander of the Syrian army and
        a leper, is told by the prophet Elisha to wash himself seven times in the river Jordan, which cures him of his
        disease.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note" data-text-content='Naaman’s story is told in 2 Kings 5.'>23</a></sup>
        The subject was occasionally depicted in biblical illustrations, and Merian himself later treated it in one of
        the plates for his influential <em>Icones biblicae</em> (Biblical Icons, 1625–1627) (<strong>fig. 7</strong>).
        In this later version, Merian was primarily concerned with translating a textual narrative into a visual format.
        We are led into the scene by the servants and soldiers on shore, who watch over Naaman’s armor as he bathes and
        with whom we bear witness to the miracle of his cure. In the background we see earlier stages in the story as
        Naaman walks with his servant toward the river. In <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, in contrast, narrative is
        subordinated to the emblematic significance of Naaman himself, who sits alone on the shore of the river, nude
        and without even his identifying armor beside him. Naaman’s meaning unfolds not through narrative but through
        his relation to the motto and epigram, both of which compare his story to the purification of the philosophers’
        stone. While this comparison had been made previously in alchemical literature, Merian for the first time
        formulates it in a visual image.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the sources for the emblem see de Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta Fugiens,”</em> 127–28.'>24</a></sup>

        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="13">Emblem 13</a></span> also exemplifies the wide
        resonance of Maier’s and Merian’s emblematic imagery within the context of the Palatinate in the early
        seventeenth century. The Rosicrucianism that informed the writings of Maier and Fludd yoked alchemical and
        hermetic thought to the pursuit of a world Reformation centered on the Elector Frederick V.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Yates, <em>Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>, 41–58.'>25</a></sup> Surely
        the significance of Naaman, as a figure of purification, extends beyond chemical transformation alone to hopes
        for a more general political and religious transformation. Merian and the de Brys shared these hopes. Although
        there is no evidence that they held specifically Rosicrucian sympathies, their very presence in Oppenheim was a
        result of the Elector’s openness to their Reformist beliefs as they sought freedom to practice their Calvinist
        faith.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Although Yates argues for the Rosicrucian sympathies of Johann Theodor de Bry, van Groesen counters that this is “at best, speculative, as his religious and spiritual preferences were not reflected in the officina’s publications.” Yates, <em>Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>, 71; Van Groesen, <em>Overseas World</em>, 94n66.'>26</a></sup>
        We might even read into the Naaman emblem an impulse toward the purification of the visual image that was
        fundamental to Reformed aesthetics. The emblem form appealed to Protestants because of its capacity to lead
        beyond the sensory appeal of the image to invisible, spiritual truths.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, for example, Diehl, “Graven Images.”'>27</a></sup> Of course the emblem could become
        corrupted, but all the more reason to bring to it a Reformer’s vigilance. In the dedicatory letters of their
        <em>Emblemata saecularia</em> (Secular Emblems, 1596, 1611), a book of emblems interleaved with blank
        escutcheons for personal autographs, Johann Theodor and Johann Israel de Bry express their desire to cleanse a
        tradition that had been defiled by lewd pictures aimed at perverting simple minds.<sup><a href="#"
            class="foot-note" data-text-content='Praz, <em>Seventeenth-Century Imagery</em>, 47–49.'>28</a></sup> A
        similar impulse informs the emblems of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. The motto of <span><a href="#"
            class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="13">Emblem 13</a></span> refers to the “Aes philosophorum,” literally
        the “philosophers’ copper,” which is sick and, like Naaman, must be washed. The relevance of the phrase to the
        material worked by the etcher could not have been lost on Merian, who by bathing his plates in acid sought to
        transform earthly copper into spiritual gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we have no textual record of Merian’s thoughts about his etchings for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, we do
        know that Maier was thinking about them in alchemical terms. Punning on the word “Venus,” the alchemical symbol
        for copper, he writes in his preface that the pictures in his book are “incised in Venus or copper, not without
        charm [<em>Venere</em>] or grace.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Veneri sive cupro, no sine Venere seu gratia, incisa.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 8.'>29</a></sup>
        Maier’s comment makes it clear, moreover, that in the alchemical pursuit of purification and universal concepts,
        the sensory appeal of Merian’s etchings, their “charm” and “grace,” cannot be ignored. In the picture for
        <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span>, for instance, a philosopher
        holds the points of an enormous pair of dividers to a wall and traces a large circle around representations of a
        man and woman who have already been inscribed within smaller geometric shapes (<strong>fig. 8</strong>). The
        emblem’s motto, taken from the <em>Rosarium philosophorum</em>, instructs the adept:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          A circle for the man and wife provide,
          Which make quadrangular with equal side,
          That trigonal, resulting in a Sphere:
          And then the blessed Stone to you will appear.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        It is a complex emblem in which the geometrical quest to square the circle is fused with the alchemical quest to
        transcend contraries: male and female, sulfur and mercury, spirit and matter.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='De Jong, <em>Michael Maier’s “Atalanta Fugiens,”</em> 166–76. For further commentary on this emblem also see Chen-Morris, “From Emblems to Diagrams,” 144–45; and Szőnyi, “Occult Semiotics and Iconology,” 316–17.'>31</a></sup>
        But for all of its preoccupation with the abstract domain of mathematical ideas, Merian’s picture insists upon
        representation as an embodied act, one that in this case is performed by a philosopher-artist on a “canvas” of
        crumbling plaster and brick whose ostentatious materiality competes with the theoretical interest of the
        emblem’s geometrical forms. In the quick and irregular hatches, dots, and scribbles of the etcher’s needle, we
        encounter a powerful evocation of earthly decay that puts one in mind of the “speaking ruins” that Giovanni Battista Piranesi will
        later depict in his masterful etchings of ancient Rome. The wall’s crumbling surface serves as a memento mori in
        the face of the philosopher’s outsized confidence in geometry. And yet the wall goes unremarked upon in Maier’s
        motto, epigram, or commentary. Instead it serves quietly as a kind of landscape, a sensory background against
        which the emblem in the foreground will be invested with meaning.

        What of those expansive landscapes that stretch out behind the figures of Sol and Luna, and behind Naaman as he
        bathes in the Jordan? Nearly all of the pictures in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>—with the exception of a few
        interior scenes, an image of the solar system, and the salamander crouching amidst flames and smoke—include at
        least some landscape elements, and many, such as <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note"
            data-emblem-id="36">Emblem 36</a></span>, are truly impressive in their breadth and detail (<strong>fig.
          9</strong>). According to this emblem’s motto, the philosophers’ stone has been “cast upon the earth, and
        exalted on mountains, and resides in the air, and is nourished in water.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Merian represents the stone as cubes, and to accommodate their elemental course through earth, air, and water,
        he sets them within a flourishing river valley. A road leads several travelers, along with the viewer, toward
        settlements that Merian’s biographer, Lucas Heinrich Wüthrich, identifies as the towns of Bad Cannstatt and Berg
        (both now incorporated into modern-day Stuttgart), located on opposite sides of the river Neckar and depicted by
        Merian in drawings he had made in 1616.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Wüthrich, <em>Matthäus Merian</em>, 229.'>33</a></sup> Beyond these towns, our eyes are

        textures of rock, architecture, vegetation, and sky.

        Merian was certainly not the first artist to attend to landscape in emblems, but the extraordinary care he gives
        to the settings of his pictures for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and for his next emblematic publication,
        Zincgref’s <em>Emblematum ethico-politicorum centuria</em>, takes this attention to an unprecedented level
        within the genre.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        In the latter volume, Merian’s depiction of specific locales in the Palatinate and surrounding regions
        anticipates his multivolume topographical publications of the 1630s and 1640s—the <em>Theatrum Europeaum</em>
        (Theater of Europe) and the <em>Topographia Germaniae</em> (Topography of Germany)—that became the basis of his

        Frederick V. The picture’s circular form, moreover, highlights its close association with the portrait medal,
        which typically included an emblematic image on its reverse and was a common form of commemorating sovereigns in
        early modern Europe. The medallion format is thus an entirely appropriate choice for emblems dedicated to the
        Elector, although it also has the effect of underscoring the allegorical function of these landscapes.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='On the connection of the portrait medal to the emblem see, for example, Daly, <em>Literature in Light</em>, 30–32. For an alternative interpretation of the circular landscape that links it not to the medal but to the telescopic view, see Powell, “Squaring the Circle.”'>36</a></sup>
        The rectangular format of Merian’s etchings for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, on the other hand, is less insistent
        on this point. These images belong to the naturalistic aesthetic of the panel picture as codified by Leon
        Battista Alberti, whose grid-based perspectival system accommodated human visual experience to the rectilinear
        picture, offering direct access to nature through its four-sided “window.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, despite Merian’s invitation to enter into the backgrounds of his alchemical emblems, these landscapes
        are not addressed in Maier’s commentaries and are rarely discussed in the scholarship on <em>Atalanta
          fugiens</em>. Why is this the case? Alberti is helpful on this question as well, for even though he praised
        the restorative effect of a pleasing landscape on the viewer, as a humanist he located the true content of the
        artwork in its <em>istoria</em>, a term that refers to harmonious and persuasive figural compositions that move
        the beholder in the same way that a well-told history moves a reader. “I look at a good painting,” writes
        Alberti, “with as much pleasure as I take in the reading of a good <em>istoria</em>. Both are the work of
        painters: one paints with words, the other tells the story with his brush.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Like a good painting, the emblem is loquacious; it speaks through mottos, epigrams, and in Atalanta fugiens its
        voice is enhanced with fugues and extensive commentaries. Landscape, in contrast, has difficulty making itself
        heard. The Latin term that Renaissance art theorists used for landscape was <em>parergon</em>, a word borrowed
        from Pliny and meaning “by-work” or, as a seventeenth-century English lexicographer put it, “all that which in a
        Picture is not of the body or argument thereof.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        A figure in the foreground reaches into a river with a long hook to pull up a piece of coral, but the picture’s
        primary visual draw is the picturesque landscape and its rich variety of vegetation, mountains, hills, and
        classical architecture that evokes Sicily where, as the epigram informs us, this moist “plant” lives. This
        etching is one of the most fully realized landscapes in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, but if we are to understand
        it according to Alberti’s humanist model of picturing, the background must be considered secondary to the alchemical content
        addressed by Maier in the emblem’s textual apparatus.

        Merian nevertheless dedicated much of his career to such supplemental work. Only a few years after the
        publication of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, for example, Peter Aubry published a view of Heidelberg by Merian that
        is very close in composition to <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="36">Emblem 36</a></span>
        (<strong>fig. 12</strong>).<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Wüthrich, <em>Das druckgraphische werk</em>, vol. 1, 132–33, catalog no. 513.'>40</a></sup>
        In this landscape, there is no philosophers’ stone to provide its “argument,” although things do happen:
        we witness the daily to and fro in the city’s outskirts as two travelers (very similar to those in Emblem 36)
        encounter a wagon along the road while boat traffic makes its way down the Neckar. These small details belong to
        the work of “chorography,” a term that early moderns took from Claudius Ptolemy, who contrasted it with the work
        of geography. While the geographer, according to Ptolemy, is concerned with the “the extent of the entire earth,
        as well as its shape, and its position under the heavens,” the chorographer focuses on surveying the local,
        “even dealing with the smallest conceivable localities, such as harbors, farms, villages, river courses, and
        such like.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='Ptolemy, <em>Geography</em>, 25–26.'>41</a></sup> It is a practice we might associate
        with the man who kneels in the left foreground of Merian’s landscape as he lays a boundary stone, and who like
        Merian himself is concerned with defining the limits of the local Palatine terrain.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this quiet chorographical work seems modest in ambition, it is difficult to overstate its importance for
        northern European art of the seventeenth century. To find a language capable of articulating this importance, we
        must look beyond the Albertian model of painting as <em>istoria</em>. Merian’s contemporary René Descartes, in
        his short treatise on optics, <em>La dioptrique</em> (Optics, 1637), points us in the right direction:
        <span class="left-space"><br>
          You can see that etchings and engravings, being made of nothing but a little ink placed here and there on the
          paper, represent to us forests, towns, men, and even battles and storms, even though, among an infinity of
          diverse qualities which they make us conceive in these objects, only in shape is there actually any
          resemblance. And even this resemblance is a very imperfect one, seeing that, on a completely flat surface,
          they represent to us bodies which are of different heights and distances, and even that following the rules of
          perspective, circles are often better represented by ovals rather than by other circles; and squares by
          diamonds rather than by other squares; and so for all other shapes. So that often, in order to be more perfect
          as images and to represent an object better, they must not resemble it.<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
              data-text-content='Descartes, <em>Discourse on Method</em>, 89–90. (Translation slightly modified.)'>42</a></sup>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing in Holland, where he had ample opportunity to encounter the topographical work of Dutch landscape
        etchers such as Visscher, Descartes recognized that the “content” of these landscapes was the nature of human
        vision itself. They show us <em>how we see</em>; that what we know to be circles, for example, are seen by the
        eye as ovals. The skilled printmaker is able to reproduce these effects on a flat surface and create a
        convincing image of the world precisely by “not resembling it” too closely. And of course we take aesthetic
        pleasure in the results, as Descartes clearly does. We are taken in by the way Merian depicts the walls,
        archways, roofs, and domes of a distant city in <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="32">Emblem
            32</a></span> with a few tiny, well-placed lines, or by the way he creates the appearance of distant trees
        rustling in the wind through the subtlest variations in his stippling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concern with optical perception in the backgrounds of Merian’s alchemical etchings would seem to be at odds
        with their emblematic foregrounds, which, after all, invite us to see beyond mere outward appearances. And
        indeed, this tension between a descriptive art focused on the visible surfaces of the world, and an emblematic
        art that seeks to reveal the meanings concealed beneath those surfaces, has figured prominently in
        art-historical debates over the proper interpretive approach to seventeenth-century northern realism.<sup><a
            href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='See, for example, Alpers, <em>Art of Describing</em>, 229–33.'>43</a></sup> We should be
        careful, however, not to ascribe these two modes of picture-making to distinct “world views.” Certainly, Merian
        and Maier would not have seen them as incompatible. In his Preface, Maier declares that it is the highest
        pursuit of the “generously educated” alchemist to disclose the “infinite” arcana that God has concealed in
        nature. But, he goes on, “next after such intellectual sciences as these are reckoned those which treat of a
        visible and audible object, as are Optics, or perspectives, and Picture.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"
            data-text-content='“Post scientias huiusmodi intellectuals proxime numerantur, que de visibili ac audibili objecto tractant, ut sunt Optica seu perspectiva, & pictura.” Maier, “Praefatio ad lectorem,” <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, 7.'>44</a></sup>
        This same hierarchical but complementary relationship between esoteric knowledge and the practical science of
        vision is rehearsed in Fludd’s <em>Utriusque cosmi</em> [. . .] <em>historia</em>, which Merian was illustrating
        at the same time he was working on <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Fludd’s first volume, <em>De macrocosmi
          structurae</em> (On the Structure of the Macrocosm, 1617), addresses the metaphysical question of cosmic
        origins, while the second volume, <em>De naturae simia</em> (On the Ape of Nature, 1618), turns its attention to
        those practical arts and sciences—including geometry, optics, and the pictorial arts—through which man becomes
        the “ape of nature.”<sup><a href="#" class="foot-note"

        Merian’s opening image for Fludd’s section on geometry and the art of measurement is, once again, a landscape
        into which we are led by a large outcropping of rock on the left and a prominent central waterway that leads the
        eye toward a distant townscape (<strong>fig. 13</strong>). In this instance, however, the work of surveying
        takes center stage as two figures demonstrate the use of a surveying staff that, along with the astronomical
        quadrant, Fludd discusses at length as essential tools for determining the size and distance of objects in the
        landscape. In the next section Fludd moves on to the science of optics where, with the help of Merian’s
        extensive illustrations, he not only explains the physiology of the eye and how it sees, but also teaches the
        art of perspective drawing. This knowledge in turn proves essential for a section on the art of picturing, and
        it is appropriate that this next section concludes, as the practical geometry section began, with a landscape
        (<strong>fig. 14</strong>). An artist-surveyor stands at the center of the composition with his back to us, his
        vision aligned with orthogonals that determine the relative size and position of objects in the picture. The art
        of picturing, Merian’s etching suggests, precisely is the delimitation of the landscape. As Ptolemy writes,
        “chorography needs an artist, and no one presents it rightly unless he is an artist.”<sup><a href="#"

        It is worth noting that the tools of the surveyor appear in one of the plates for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> we
        have already considered. In <span><a href="#" class="emblem-note" data-emblem-id="21">Emblem 21</a></span>, a
        quadrant and what looks like a simple surveying instrument called a “Jacob’s staff,” both of which Merian
        illustrated for Fludd, lie at the feet of the alchemist (<strong>fig. 15</strong>). Although he has dropped them
        in favor of the compasses, a symbol of theoretical rather than practical labor, these abandoned instruments
        suggest that the pursuit of metaphysical truths begins in the field. It is here, at the feet of this
        artist-philosopher, that we should locate Merian’s contribution to <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.

        In the backgrounds of Merian’s emblems, the landscape quietly establishes the rules according to which nature is
        perceived, measured, and represented. While the alchemist may seek to reveal meanings concealed behind these
        appearances, Merian’s landscapes provide the practical conditions for emblematic interpretation, which must
        begin with the senses. It is a lesson contained in the master trope of Maier’s book, the foot race between
        Atalanta and Hippomenes, which Merian depicts in the lower left corner of the title page (<strong>fig.
          16</strong>). Seeking to win the race and Atalanta’s love, Hippomenes casts the golden apples that Venus has
        given him into Atalanta’s path. Unable to resist the fruit, Atalanta slows down to retrieve it, allowing
        Hippomenes to overtake her. Much has been written, by Maier and by subsequent scholars, about how this myth
        provides a metaphor for the pursuit of the philosophers’ stone through the union of sulfur (Hippomenes) and
        mercury (Atalanta). But it is also a story about the fifty copper plates that are cast before the reader of
        <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Only by slowing down to reflect on their surfaces, on the “charm” and “grace” of
        landscapes in which the etcher’s needle brilliantly takes the measure of the world and of human perception, can
        we grasp their significance in the alchemical pursuit of nature’s secrets.
