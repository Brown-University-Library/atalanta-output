Misc. notes re: “101”s (Get Acquainted sections)
======

## Re: all three
* ~~top nav is not yet included (not yet final from SR & Jake)~~
* bottom footer is not yet final
* overall page structure & styling based on Jake’s implementation of essay sections, but top header styling has been altered for these shorter “get acquainted” sections
* currently linked custom JavaScript will need to be swapped to Jake’s final provided file(s), or his Hugo setup’s output; temporality, for draft purposes, using compiled version from SiteSucker app (via code at http://atalanta.dev.jakeandco.com)
